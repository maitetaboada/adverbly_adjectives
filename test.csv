"I think the program needs some work and probably some very costly oversight to prevent human rights abuses according to this report from the Canadian Labour Congress:'Canada's Temporary Foreign Worker Program is far from being a modelinitiative. Given the experiences of the Canadian labour movement, it isabundantly clear that the program's design permits the exploitation ofmigrant workers. It operates to serve employers' interests with littlemeaningful regard for compliance, monitoring, or enforcement of nationalor subnational labour standards.'www.canadianlabour.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/model-program-or-mistake-2011-en.pdf"
"This is just 'offshoring' in reverse as well as union busting. Say goodbye to the things unions got us like annual 2 week paid vacations, paid stat holidays, weekends, 40hr workweeks and eventually all benefits. Just remember all this s--t come next election."
How do you spell exploitation? This is a disgusting practice that sanctions abuses of fundamental rights and human decency. We cannot continue to condone it. EJSscraba Victoria BC
"TFWs have a place in the economy. Most Canadians would not leave home to live on-site at the farm in order to pick vegetables. This is a good TFW job in seasonal work. The added benefit is that they have limited interaction with residents of this country. TFWs should not be employed in towns and cities, preparing food or doing landscaping or construction. These zones should be governed by the rules of the market - if they can't find workers at the remuneration they are offering, then they should close."
"Why should temporary workers get paid more?? How about Tim Horton's and all the rest of the companies rushing to hire all of these temporary foreign workers hire CANADIANS and PAY THEM A LIVING WAGE? HOW ABOUT THAT, HUH? This whole temp worker incentive is a drive the labour force to the bottom, nothing more. The government should be much tougher on hiring practices with these companies and instead build incentives for young Canadians, and especially in apprenticeship programs."
"No sense playing games with words. The temporary foreign worker program is the same as the European guest worker program, except worse. The Europeans had a genuine worker shortage in the last decades of the last century. We do not have a worker shortage so much as a demand by employers to have access to cheap and dependable workers. They are dependable because they can not search for another job with better pay or working conditions. Why can we not let the market do its work? It will discover the proper wage for a greenhouse and Tim Hortons worker."
"There will never be any reason or any excuse for the existence of a temporary foreign worker program in Canada. The first mandate of the federal government is to promote the well-being of the Canadian people, both in the short term and the long term. The only long term effects of a TFW program will be: Lower average wages Reduce the wage multiplier effect Eliminate training and professional growth opportunities for youth Create an underground of illegal workers Increase social costs to CanadiansI have always been a PC supporter, but this TFW program strikes me as criminally insane. It should not be modified or changed or improved. It should be ELIMINATED, immediately."
"TFWs have a place in the economy. Most Canadians would not leave home to live on-site at the farm in order to pick vegetables. This is a good TFW job in seasonal work. TFWs should not be employed in towns and cities, preparing food or doing landscaping or construction."
"TFWs work against the tenets of the free market. In a free market, wages (like prices) are set by the market - if you pay too low, nobody buys into your job. As with prices, you have to price your job to meet the market. Then you bring in the Conservatives, who claim to be faithful to the market economy, and they skew the market by allowing employers not only to bring in people from overseas to take the positions but allow them to pay below market wages. This party is not a free market party, it is a corporatist party, and they are NOT the same."
like to give you 10 thumbs up
"TFWs have a proper place in the economy. Do you want to live in a bunkhouse at the farm during the harvest season? Some of these farms would have to close down if TFWs were not available, otherwise they could not compete with produce from California picked by Mexicans. TFWs should not be allowed to compete for jobs in the cities and towns, however."
"I think we have HD Mining to thank for the notice we are finally paying to TFWs. When they were nannies and coffee servers, we didn't really notice them, and about the only other time they come to our attention is when every second liftie at the ski hill is an Aussie. I think there can be a case made for the Aussie liftie - go to Canada for a year, have an adventure, go home. More of our kids should probably do the same. The nanny and coffee server situation doesn't make us look too good. Come to Canada, raise our children and pour our coffee for us, but don't expect anything in return - like the same chance that the immigrants I'm descended from had - to work their butts off so their descendants (me and mine) could have an easier life. We are, to put it bluntly, exploiting them. With the HD Mining situation, the narrative has changed again from adventure seeker to exploited underclass to skilled workers who will work for less than Canadian skilled workers, and have no ties to Canada. They will send their wages home. HD Mining will sent the coal home, and in the long run Canada will be left with nothing but a hole in the ground while the mining companies and the miners go on to exploit some other country with resources to sell. The exploiter becomes the exploited and we have only ourselves to blame. The TFW program needs to be stopped. Immigration needs to be opened up to people willing to work their way into Canada rather than buying their way in with the investor class, because that policy seems to have lead to a housing bubble and not much else in the way of econiomic stimulus."
it's not the same thing. We're developing a new underclass of illegals.
"Yep. And along the way they find underground work, which should be getting done by a Canadian."
wow you are a fool
"By law, employers can pay them five to 15 per cent less than Canadians. That is because, in theory, there are no locals available to fill these jobs.----------------------------------------------------------------How does the second sentence logically follow from the first? Furthermore, how is a four year limit on foreign workers called 'temporary'?It's cruel exploitation of foreign workers. Immigration is one of the worst swindles in history. Plundering Third World nations of their professionals, falsely promising them accreditation, paying them lower wages, pitting them against locals in a race to the bottom, stirring up conflict among the working classes, burying native Canadians under a deluge of immigrants that destroys communities, working class solidarity and Canadian values."
Hmmm. I don't recall this being part of the Conservative election platform. Wonder why...
"No political party wants a public debate on immigration. It's a thing that impacts every facet of our lives, but they want to keep immigration policy-making behind closed doors."
"So instead of complaining, we need some of the unemployed Canadians to do these jobs. Why don't they? Because, they are underpaid (however better this than not paid), dirty, unsafe etc. all we are doing is passing off our dirty work to needy foreigners and then not even treating them properly. Most well-off Western countries do this and then they are surprised by the resentment, social unrest, even violence that this leads to. Stop it and train Canadians, whether they want this or not. Keep jobs here, don't we need them?"
"If someone's running a business no Canadians want to work in, he'd best be getting a better business. He needs to report himself to the Better Business Bureau."
"In Iceland, all the jobs are done by the Icelanders. In Japan, all jobs are done by Japanese. It's a safe assumption that they found a solution to 'jobs nobody wants to do'."
"Not quite true, in Iceland they do often bring in extra workers for the height of the fishing season but they are paid the same as the local workers and, with a population of 300k, are only brought in fi no Icelanders are available, not if no icelanders are not willing to work at that rate. Here it is used as a wage suppresent, there it is used because there are, literally, not enough people living in the country to handle the workload. It is done to boost the national economy, not to boost corporate profits."
"The TFW policy is flat our wrong on virtually every front. It is bad economic policy, bad politics, and morally repugnant. The only people served by it are a few rapacious employers. As this is the Harper government, to date those few beneficiaries have been all that mattered. The only hope for change is that it becomes a political issue in Alberta, among workers/voters tired of wage suppression."
"This issue needs front and centre attention. How can we possibly tolerate thousands of people in various parts of this country going unemployed or under-employed and continue to bring these people in?This is simply cynical corporate profit making. The Conservative government has a lot to answer for if they don't stop this process. The next election platform for the government should be all about Canadian jobs, jobs, jobs for CANADIANS."
"As the neocons would like to say, we could put a price on every stream and every unspoiled space in this country, after all, they are 'underperforming' if they're not being exploited to earn money. Mass immigration is just like throwing logs on a bonfire to quickly heat the economy. Next year you'll need just as many. It's a Ponzi scheme for the wealthy. Economic aggrandizement is not the highest purpose in life. Our purpose is to honour the legacy of our forefathers, who sacrificed to build this land and give us so much."
"1. There should be a surcharge tax on all work permit workers, the proceeds of which go to train Canadians. 2. If someone is in Canada doing a skilled job for 24 months in any three year period they should automatically be converted to landed immigrant status. What happens in the USA is employers import people on work permits and treat them like slaves. They love green cards because the employee is bound to them. Loose your job and be kicked out of the country. A good way to extract free overtime, even if the person does know their human rights. In the USA you can stay 7 years on a work permit (this may be a bit out of date). So employers will hold out the promise of a green card for those 7 years, but when they are up they ship the person back to Indian or wherever. The last thing those employers want is another person with the skills living in the USA creating competition for their imported guys."
"I work in IT, one of the industries where we supposedly need guest workers because of the lack of skilled Canadians. In many cases there are skilled Canadians. What employers do is tell bureaucrats that there are no Canadians who know version 7 of 'X' programming language and that version 6 is totally different. Or they'll say that X programming language is totally different than Y and people cannot be retrained. Basically they're going for the lower wages and unpaid overtime you can get out of people who have no idea of what human rights are. It is a warm body, and even if that body works 10 hours to be 50% less productive than an available Canadian, they can still bill the client 100% of the billing rate for all the hours worked."
"So someone advertises for a nanny at $11 an hour and no one takes it because nannies charge $20 an hour in Canada. Therefore a foreign one comes in, takes the job for $11, sends most of the money 'home' which is used to buy things back in the old country and contributes negatively to Canada's balance of trade. The person employing the nanny is working for a full Canadian wage, but yet not willing to pay a full Canadian wage to their employee.....hypocritical at best. This type of thing should not happen. Oh...also, the 'discount' nanny gets a fast track to permanent resident/family immigration, etc. Our country is giving up a lot in order for someone to save $9 an hour on their nanny."
Our heritage is being given away as the major portion of the compensation package that the nanny-employer doesn't want to pay. When were Canadians given an informed referendum on giving away citizenships so cheaply?
"Not only that, but these people's children are effectively raised and brought up by these foreign nannies....however loving they may be, is that what parents want? Again, think of the LT consequences."
"A proposition for you, Aniechka, old chum. Dispite the natural filth of our pathetic (presumably Cockney) nanny, I'll wager that I can pass her off as a duchess at the ambassador's garden party within a fortnight! What have you?"
The guest worker program is there to suppress liveable wages to enjoy a Canadian standard of living. It interferes with supply and demand for the profit of a few. Unemployment rates would be much lower if liveable wages could be earned without having to compete with third world dictated minimum wages and harpo's new EI eligibility rules.
"This is nonsense. The TFW program has saved the service industry in Alberta. The federal gov't determines the baseline wage that must be paid by job classification in each community based on local wage norms. TFW's can only be hired after a business has advertised extensively for local workers. The cost to a business to bring in TFW's is very expensive (consulting and recruitment fees, flights,housing costs etc.) so why would a business incur these costs if they could avoid them by hiring locally? Your article demonstrates no 'on-the-ground' knowledge of the TFW program and it's costs and hardships to business turning to this program to get desparately needed workers. Thank goodness for the TFW program where I live. The alternative would mean shuttered business's or at least drastically reduced operating hours and service. And by the way, the TFW's working here are hard-working,great people trying to do a good job and make a life for themselves. They deserve our respect."
"No one's disrespecting the temporary foreign workers, just the programme itself. I'm 'on the ground' here in AB and the service industries I see profiting from TFW are the fast food franchises - Tim Hortons, Subway etc. There are charges of abuse as many of these TFWs are living in houses provided by the owners of the franchises in which they work - for considerable rent. And there are other problems which I 'm sure you see if you are indeed 'on the ground' as well."
"Then pay them the same wages as a Canadian or even more for the inconvenience of having to leave everything behind to come to Canada for 4 years..,,,but don 't shed crocodile tears when the only reason that they are in Canada is because they are legally paid 5-15% lesss. Where is the free market? If too many jobs in Alberta service industries are going unfilled, then perhaps they should raise the wages until the jobs are filled! That is supply and demand..."
@ Temper... Exactly right. Funny how the 'free' market is not OK in this situation. So 'not OK' that corps lobbied the 'Harper Government' to create a policy to circumvent the free market. How f@#ked is that? The Harper govt must go.
"The costs of bringing in a TFW are minor compared to the extra $10,000 to $100,000 per year profits you can make off of each one. Remember, there are economies of scale here. You don't do a separate set of job postings for each position, it is do one set of ads and you are good for the year. So $1,000 in advertising expenses. The flight is $1,000. But then you can put 4 people in a room and charge each $500 a month in rent -- another revenue source you would not have with a Canadian. As tempsperdue says, allow the law of supply and demand to work for Canadians. Allow wages to go up to their natural levels. Only bring in TFWs for jobs lasting less than 6 months or requiring more than 3 months re-training."
Too effin' bad if the local businessman can't find anyone to staff his franchise for minimum wage. That just tells us that his business plan isn't viable. We shouldn't have to sacrifice our national character and give away our land for the wealthy few to get return on investments.
".And by the way, the TFW's working here are hard-working,great people trying to do a good job and make a life for themselves. They deserve our respect.-------------------------------------------------------Sure. They're so good they don't even know the meaning of the word 'entitlements'. Employers need to fire the entire Canadian workforce and replace them with foreign workers. Better still replace them with robots. Robots require no feeding, clothing or housing. Just a little oiling and tightening of the screws."
"with an unemployment rate of 7% it just means the wages being offered are to low, also what is the justification for getting in Indians to do IT ? Why are IT wages less then 20 years ago...?"
"All of this is true. Further, the hazards of the temporary foreign worker programme - specifically its likeness to some European processes where they DO have a problem with immigration - has been talked about since, oh 2006. Yet the Globe consistently promoted Harper policies in general and Jason 'curry in a hurry' Kenney's 'reforms' in particular. What's changed Globe? Did you think the Harper Government (TM) would magically get something right?"
"Well, no kidding. The Conservatives claim to want assimilation, but then they do everything in their power to make it impossible."
"Everything? That is a huge statement when we are talking about a narrow issue. I'm an immigrant myself, an naturalized Canadian. Getting away from the LPC cultural mosaic theory is something probably 80% of us wish would happen. The ghettoization that the cultural mosaic promotes, versus the integration of the melting pot is the main point of difference between the political parties."
"@VertKnightAny source for the 80% stat you're talking about? Also, if the Conservatives are advocating for a melting pot society, any links for something like that? Surely there's got to be something featuring 'Curry in a Hurry' saying something like 'wel"
What is the reason behind allowing employers to hire temporary workers for less wages than they are legally obliged to pay Canadian workers? This is a recipe for disaster. Stop this insane practice.
I agree. If there are no skilled Canadians for the job bring in TFWs but pay them the same as Canadians. Otherwise some less-than-honorable companies are going to bring in foreign workers just to save a few bucks.
Pay them the same as Canadians and tax the employer an additional 10% to pay for training Canadian workers.
"The reason is likely that you don't need to pay social security type benefits for people that are never going to be around to collect. This is slightly off topic, but in Myrtle Beach you'd be hard pressed to find an American employee in any of the seasonal beach type businesses - they're all East European, and locals can't compete with them on wages since there's about a 20% differential with the fringes taken out."
"As one analyst puts it - and I totally agree with him:-'The message is crystal clear - your economic model has to change. They will no longer accept the idea of a national economy within the eurozone that is dependent on its reputation as an offshore tax haven.''There is huge irritation with the way the Cypriots have handled things, and that has led to the imposition of deadlines which mean big decisions need to be taken very quickly.''The cost of cleaning up the Cypriot banking system must be borne by investors in the Cypriot banking system - like it or lump it.'"
"I think it's basically right that the EU demands $6-billion contribution from Cyprus for a further $12-billion bailout of Cyprus's banks, financial system, and its entire low-tax economy. The EU bailout should also come with strings attached, such as Cyprus's entire financial system is brought under proper control, and Cyprus as a tax-haven for foreigners should be discontinued. On the news today I learned that there's 60,000 UK pensioners living in Cyprus. Many of those pensioners are upset that they could lose 3%-10% of their savings in Cypriot banks. One UK pensioner on BBC World News wants Cyprus to leave the EU and go back to the Cypriot pound. That made me laugh. If that happens the Cypriot pound will be devalued at least 90% and all those UK pensioners will therefore lose 90% of their savings as opposed to 2%-3% for the majority of them (now they're talking 0% for savings less than ?100,000).The other thing I learned in the news was that these UK pensioners who have enjoyed very low taxes in Cyprus for years were also able to claim the UK home heating winter fuel allowance even though they're living in Cyprus! That's nice considering Cyprus is a cool 20 Celsius in January. At least I'm glad the EU is clamping down on these jurisdictions that spell trouble for everyone with their low taxes, laws enabling tax avoidance/evasion, and their generally under-regulated banking and financial systems taking advantage of the $euro currency and laundering dirty money from dodgy business."
Fire up the printing presses. The global shortage of new money to cover old debts is reaching its final stage. Pass the popcorn.
"The provinces are fiscal bad boys. Chretien and Martin were correct in cutting their transfers. There is a problem or risk though. If the poor provinces or Quebec get too annoyed, they start getting geo-political. This is where we run into problems."
Hollowing out Canada of all industries except Bitumen Bubble and Housing Bubble. That is the legacy of Stephen Harper. It doesn't matter how you spin the rest of the story.
"It's in the math. There are insufficient funds coming into the treasury to cover the cost of programs. This is because the revenue has been slashed for short term gain creating a deficit circumstance; this government has engaged in frivolous, non-strategic spending commitments that have accelaerated the drainage of limited funds, and the US economy has still shown no realistic signs of a rapid recovery. Growing the economy and tax cuts for the wealthy have been found to be lacking credibility as economic stimulants since Reagan proposed 'trickle down economics', or perhaps more accurately, 'Voodoo economics.'In their first year or so in office, the CP of C has undone ten years of Liberal efforts to wrestle the deficit and national debt under control; if they think they can get it back within the next three years, they are dreaming in Technicolor. Their record in Ontario should have been an omen. The house is not in order; the tax payer will pay no matter what province he/she lives in."
"The biggest one to be cut, or should be cut is the tax credit. Billions of dollars to millions of Canadians at a cost to.... mllions of Canadians. All i the nt poor section of Canadians. Read Lower Tax Guide - a guide to selfishness,"
Screw the provinces. Isn't that what Harper and Flaherty accused the Chretien/Martin Liberals of doing?
"No, that was left historians and newspaper columnists."
"Health care is a fat cow that must be trimmed constantly. The feds will force that, which is a good thing."
"Asinine. The feds transferring money to provinces and anybody else they want to transfer money to.Provinces and lower levels of government need the taxing powers commensurate with their responsibilities. Ditto for the feds. NO transfer of funds between levels of government. The current system allows the feds to blame the provinces for not meeting their responsibilities and the provinces of course respond with lack of transfer of funds from the feds. John Baird, MP for a section of Ottawa determines whether Ottawa will have light rail for example. No responsibility whatever but the power to cancel through funding. And while we are amending the constitution to fix that we can amend the Charter so police cannot violate with impunity. For example breathalyzer tests on an Arnprior dentist were withdrawn because a police officer had not acted in a timely manner in laying charges. The officer violated the Charter and does not face charges. I am proposing that there be a law against stealing but no penalty for stealing. OOOps. Our Constitution needs to be amended so that taxing powers are commensurate with responsibilities at each layer of government."
". Flaherty's house is in order, but the provinces will payWell, that is probably a fair assessment of the fed/provincial budget economics We/Canada can sustain a 600 billion dollar debt, as well, if Flaherty's #'s are correct, we should be in a positive/surplus budget scenario by 2015/16. The problem being; the provinces are left alone to do the heavy lifting on the one and MAJOR expenditure which will affect provincial budgets for many years if not decades to come; Healthcare espendituresUnless we as a nation 'sit down' and initiate a meaningful discussion on healthcare and sharing of resources between the provinces (IE; cooperation) the provinces will have a very difficult time in balancing their respective budgets. It is really as simple as that.."
"A flawed assumption in most of these arguments is that seniors will not move to other provinces. So if Atlantic Canadian seniors cannot get timely health services in their home province, they, too, will move West and burden those provinces. The idea that populations are static is false. They are only static now because Federal transfers keep people in ageing, mostly rural areas. one those transfers are cut, the people will not necessarily stay. Alberta will inherit a LOT of older Eastern Canadians needing senior care. Once the support for them to stay is removed, they, like their children, will 'go down the road to the West'."
"From the article: 'One reason provincial finances are so bleak relates to declining federal transfer payments.'================This is straight up, 100% *WRONG*Federal transfer payments are *NOT* declining in any way, shape or form. They are increasing not only in terms of inflation-adjusted dollars, but they are increasing as a percentage of GDP. Every year the Federal government transfers a larger and larger portion of the entire Canadian economy to Provincial governments in order to spend. The issue is *NOT* that transfer payments are declining, but rather that costs are rising out of control! And why shouldn't they? After all, the Provinces can just whine and complain to the Federal government about 'declining transfer payments'. Why should they bother being accountable when it is MUCH easier, politically speaking, to just beg for money handouts from another government and force that other government to take the money from citizens via taxation."
"Having one government tax us just so that they can turn around and give the money to another government to spend is about the stupidest thing we do in Canada. If Health Care is supposed to be a Provincial responsibility than let the Provinces take care of it! We should eliminate 100% of the health care transfer payments from the Federal government to the Provincial government, cut Federal taxes and raise Provincial taxes and be done with it.Alternatively make Health Care a Federal responsibility and have the Federal government collect the tax dollars to pay for it and operate the program in it's entirety. After all, does someone living in Charlottetown really have that different of health care needs from someone living in Sudbury? Or Winnipeg? Or Iqaluit? Having one government collect the money and another government spend the money removes the most fundamental of all financial concepts: Obtaining value for money. Why should the Provinces seek to provide effective services for the tax dollars they raise if they can just whine and beg the Federal government for more and more money?"
".Tony.........Healthcare spending in Canada (2012) was close to 200 billion dollars (public and private). Of that 200 billion the Feds put up 24 billion in transfers, that # is to sink to approximately as a percentage of overall healthcare spending by 2018 The problem being; The Feds are suppose to enforce equal healthcare services across Canada as clearly stipulated in the Canada Health Act. Will they give up this power/jurisdiction any-time soon? No way.."
"Tony .10:00 AM on March 21, 2013As you say health care is supposed to be a provincial responsibility. It was taken over by the feds by blackmail - join the federal scheme or you don't get any federal money. This was challenged by the Canadian Medical Association. After about 2 years it quietly withdrew the suit. A common practice with unions dealing with government. So our constitution does not mean a thing. Might is right. The feds can take over anything it wants since it has the taxing powers. The best thing that could happen for the standard of health care in Canada and for the deficit is to have health care in the private sector."
"Canada1, I realize that health care costs are expanding *VASTLY* in excess of our ability to pay for them. That much has been clear for almost a decade now. Every year health care eats up a bigger and bigger portion of our economy and that simply can't go on forever. Granted we're hardly alone here, virtually every developed country is facing the same scenario. However that doesn't take away from the basic problem in Canada: We have the Provinces unwilling to give up Federal funding or control of health care. We have the Federal government unwilling to increase funding or give up their portion of control. Two levels of government fighting over their little fiefdom while us taxpayers spend money to cover all the waste that this involves. My personally preference would be to have health care fully moved up to the Federal level. Right now we have 11 different health care systems in this country. Why?!?! Much larger and more diverse countries than ourselves have unified health care systems."
"The only debt clock that has Canada above the USA and close to the UK. First prize for selectivity. Every other net debt comparison that I am aware of has Canada just over 60%,and UK and USA around 75%. Of course if you insist on ignoring over 300 billion dollars of funds for public pensions that barely exist in the other two countries you will come up with this nonsense."
"I'm not exactly sure of the Economist's methodology, however, according to an article last month in the G&M Canada's combined federal/provincial public debt at the end of the 2011/12 budget year was 61.5% of GDP. It's still not good, but not quite as drastic as the Economist's figure."
"This is garbage, Yakboy. Calling Flapper's empty plans a fait accompli of deficit elimination is either the stupidest or most blatantly dishonest bit of bias I've seen from your rag since Ibby stopped writing for the general readership."
"Pathological Flaherty bashing aside, it is the provinces that do the heavy lifting on the big ticket items, health care and education, and the feds intervening simply leads to duplication and waste. The two point cut in the HST gave the provinces room to raise taxes, which most of them did. At the end of the day, there are limits to what the feds can do."
Same 'ol story with this Harris bunch of PCs in Ottawa. The only fiscal recipe they know is to download the cost on to another level of government. They did the same thing in Ontario by downloading the responsibility and cost of provincial services on to the backs of municipalities. Yet when they were kicked out of office in 2003 they had hidden a nice $5 billion deficit on the books.
"Even if the $5B deficit wasn't a one off caused by the blackout and SARS, compared to what McGuinty has done I would call it 'the good old days'."
"This budget reflects the ideology of the Conservative Party. The idea that the federal government has an important role to play in keeping Canada together and assisting Canadians across the board is completely alien to them. Instead, they pursue a twisted vision of 'provincilal rights' which means, essentially, that standards of living across Canada will depend entirely on the present wherewithal of the province a person happens to live in. Provinces that have the ability to raise taxes and other revenue to make up for federal shortfalls will do well; those that don't will suffer, and the dynamic making people leave them for greener pastures will accelerate. In the meantime, the federal government keeps cutting taxes, increasing the disparites of wealth between the haves and have nots. Worrying about a federal deficit in the middle of a recession is abysmally stupid, but it fits right into the ideology. Let's not kid ourselves about the CP being 'moderates' or not having a 'hidden agenda.' The difference today is that the agenda is no longer hidden. It's pretty obvious, if one just looks closely. (John Ibbitson might want to try this)."
"I'm sorry but what about this is a surprise? With Jim Flaherty, it's always been about someone else paying for hist 'vision. One only needs to look at his term as Finance Minister in Mike Harris' laughably-named 'Common Sense Revolution' with its massive downloading of costs onto cities to see how Jimmy (in his eyes anyway) gets himself out of a pinch and claims 'success'. He's a tool, truly and a pox on the fools who knew better and voted for the Tories."
"Joseph_Willcawks writes: 'With Jim Flaherty, it's always been about someone else paying for hist 'vision.'====================Wait... so by *NOT* having the Federal government paying for Provincial responsibilities Flaherty is looking for someone else to pay for his vision? Isn't the problem really that the Provinces are looking for the Feds to pay for THEIR vision? Besides, no downloading is occurring at all. The Federal government is sending more money to the Provinces than ever before, so the entire basis of this article is based on a totally incorrect assumption. The issue has *NOTHING* to do with reducing Federal transfer payments and everything to do with increased spending at the Provincial level. To put this in perspective, if health care costs doubled tomorrow the author of this article would be SCREAMING at the Federal government for cutting transfer payments in half."
"'Harper plays a shell game by downloading the financial pain to the Provinces, and then 'blames' the Provinces for mismanaging their economies.' according to K Wright. I am pretty sure that is a similar comment on Paul Martin's budget strategy, were you as concerned at that point? He was quite proud of eliminating the deficit, however, it was also partly due to restriction of EI payments and subsequent transfer of EI surplus to the general ledgers and by reducing the payments to the provinces for Health and other services funded by the feds."
"At least Martin had budget surpluses year after year. The only surpuses Harper had were the residual effects from the Martin years. He squandered all that extra cash. We may have gotten a break on the GST, but our children will pay for it."
"Remember ... Martin left a surplus, and Harpo and Flapper ruined it."
"Trust the 'steady hand on the till' and what do you get? A sputtering Canadian economy that is comparable to the Mulroney Conservative Government's deficit. The only difference, Harper plays a shell game by downloading the financial pain to the Provinces, and then 'blames' the Provinces for mismanaging their economies. Unemployemt, poverty, and debt is what the Harper Government is delivering while spending millions telling us they are all about jobs, growth and prosperity. By far the most incompetent government in modern Canadian history."
Sticky hand in the till.
"K Wright writes: 'The only difference, Harper plays a shell game by downloading the financial pain to the Provinces'================The fallacy of your argument, and indeed of this article as a whole, is that the Federal government is transferring more money to the Provincial governments than ever before. The author is straight up wrong, and easily verified as such. Transfer payments are up, *WAY* up. Not just relative to inflation, but relative to GDP. The problem is that the costs to administer these programs is rising at an even faster rate. Canada's economy is growing at an average rate of about 3 or 4% per year. Transfer payments are going up by 6% per year. Costs are going up by 7 or 8% per year. It is also somewhat interesting that you complain about Harper and Mulroney and ignore Chretien who actually *DID* cut transfer payments. In fact, under Chretien transfer payments were cut *DRASTICALLY*, being reduced by some 30% in nominal dollars (and closer to 50% when seen relative to GDP).This was a VERY smart policy by Chretien and one that Harper *SHOULD* be emulating, but he's not. Instead he just keeps giving more and more money to the Provinces."
The provinces waste money. They take the money and then give their workers raises.
"My 2 cents: fire every single last one of them. Everyone. Replace that vast majority with a web site designed by Google that serves Canadians instantly and better. Farm out all call centres to Asia. Nobody should be making $30/hr answering phone calls (badly). This should bring our tax bills down about 50%. Our economy would thrive, even though it would be populated with legions of unemployed, skill-less former federal worker bees that have zero relevant skills to offer any real employer. The public sector does NOT exist to provide Canadians with jobs. It exists to provide us with services at the cheapest rate possible. I am the customer, not the piggy bank. My needs come WAY before the needs of federal employees. As a matter of fact, the needs of federal employees should not even factor in to any labour decisions."
The government does NOT create wealth. Period. It drains it from those of us who do. Period.
"Another insightful article from Wente. We have allowed unions to shoot us in the feet to win an eternity of jobs for themselves by exploiting the greed that can lie in human hearts. And short-sighted, unconscionable politicians let it happen to save themselves from the difficult task of searching for employee/management solutions .No 'Profiles in Courage' here. How dare they create such indebtedness for Canadians and their children."
"It's bash the workers time again. Funny, the period over which this became a 'problem' coincides exactly with the three decades in which the executive and financial classes have hogged just about all the fruits increased worker productivity to themselves at the expense of the very workers who made it possible. Their reduced real income has cost the government tax receipts at the same time as the wealthy have been benefitted from lower tax rates. THIS is what will sink our grandchildren, not some imagined grievance against government employees."
"I think this article isn't about bashing workers, it's about workers who don't show up for work."
"This article is just more public-sector bashing. I went to school for ten years to acquire the skills I need to do my job. So, yes, I make more than the average worker; but, I think the expertise I bring to the table is worth something. I have, on average, taken fewer than four sick days per year. Also, I'm not allowed to accumulate unused sick time. Speaking of which, if so many of us lazy public sector employees are taking so much sick time, why is there an unused sick-time liability of $5 billion? Pensions and sick leave, etc., used to be standard for anyone with a decent job. Perks were things like company cars and expense accounts. Instead of asking why public sector workers still have pensions, paid sick leave, etc., you should be asking why YOU don't anymore. Why is it than in times when corporations report record profits and the stock market hits all-time highs, things for the middle class don't really get any better? Why could our parents raise a family on one income; but, now it takes two? I'm not saying that there aren't areas that need improvement; there is in any large organization; but, when I see things like 'For taxpayers, they're an infuriating example of public-sector entitlement' it just gets my back up. I work in a hospital with doctors, nurses and other staff whose whole job is to be there on the worst day of your life and help you to the best of their ability. If that doesn't deserve a little extra sick time (note that they're exposed to sick and dying people all the time), I don't know what does."
"You 'think' your expertise is 'worth something'? You uneducated rube! In the real world, what YOU think is exactly meaningless. In a market, where my labour is bought and sold, the only thing that matters is what the MARKET thinks your skills are worth. So your PHD in sociology might have taken you 10 years, but the 'skills' you derive from it are completely worthless. Otherwise, you and your fellow worker bees would all find yourselves flipping burgers were it not for the racket you are running on us tax payers. Does this sound harsh? Suck it up, buttercup. I am only holding you to the same standard I hold myself to."
"Here's a solution: Force governments to amend labour legislation to reflect any changes they agree to in public sector collective agreements beyond basic wages. Equality in pensions, healthcare, benefits and working conditions would be achieved and governments will be held to account for the changes they enact."
"There is NOTHING in the labour legislation for public sector employees that is not already there for ALL Canadians - because they all work under precisely the same laws. However, there are SOME people who are willing to NEGOTIATE with their employers to have a portion OF their pay paid in the form of an employer pension contribution and are willing to NEGOTIATE to have a portion of their pay used to pay for a benefits package. Note the use of the word OF, joannie! It would be ideal for ALL Canadians to be having their employer put aside a portion OF their compensation into a pension plan but most employees seem to prefer to take the money in cash, tell themselves I will save for my RRSP but instead take that winter break in Cuba. Everyone can have equality in pensions and benefits since everyone operates under precisely the same laws. There is nothing to prevent you from negotiating a far BETTER pension and benefits package than public sector workers. it's your choice."
"While I agree with Ms. Wente's point pension benefit contributions between the federal government and employees should be increased such that that employees pay more of the contribution, like the Ontario public service and even more so what Ontario is doing with the the Teachers pension fund. Ms. Wente is way off line in telling that there is no problem in the reason federal workers are having mental illness. The main reason is the terrible policy of the government which has resulted in terrible managers who lack people's skills and who are mostly boomer women whose kids have moved out or are DINKS. I had one and all she did was to go on 6 months out of twelve of training leaving the team leaders who themselves were boomers who would never retire in charge. and where I worked the turnover was 50% because the younger workers (younger boomers and/or Gen X) were burned out by the terrible management of these DINKS old ladies. There are too many managers as compared to workers, look at how compensation for workers is rising from an average of $49,000 to an expected $130,000. Mostly because the government is laying off younger more junior workers instead of laying off middle managers. For example that same manager I had, was having 35+ years of pension service so she could get a great pension (70% of her final 3-year average salary, too good if you ask me as compared to the younger ones starting today), but she still isn't retiring. Forcing more of the older boomer workforce, especially middle managers to higher up Director Generals, ADMs and DMs whose wage bill has also gone up retire would do wonders to the overall wage bill of the federal government. Really for all the political correctness around, the most productive workers are in their 30s and 40s who have experience but aren't how do we say this politely over the hill when it comes to new technology like social media etc. and new methods of management. Paul Martin was right in the 1994 budget etc, buy out the old geezers! Finally, as this COMMENTARY IS WRITTEN BY A KNOWN PLAGIARIST who would have been fired by a more respectable newspaper like the New York Times, we must wonder if in fact who really should be fired. Well then again this newspaper has a so called report in John Ibbotson who is nothing but a propaganda mouthpiece for the PMO PR hacks. Seriously, the Parliamentary Budget Officer to outside institutes even right wing ones friendly to the Tories Dear Leader micromanagement control freak like the CD Howe Institute have noted that there is too much hiring of PR hacks. If the government laid off most ( the term used for 'information' personnel) workers, let's face it who needs media relations for a government? There wouldn't be a deficit! How much spending was done on the propoganda crap of the Canada Economic Action Plan by DUMBO Flaherty and Dear Leader Harper. How much of taxx payers money was wasted on just internal opinion polls!"
"Is that so, joe, and I suppose that you hasve the data and the knowledge to back that up.Oh, just hearsay. That's what I thought. Joe, your rants are about as accurate and relevant to today as your reds under the bed and DB plans are ponzi's.Time to get out of mama's basement and seethe real world!"
Get back to work Cratchett!
"I've worked in the public sector for 25 years. I agree that a large percentage of employees are dedicated and hard working. But maybe 20% have such a huge entitlement attitude that I'm now convinced we are heading the way of Greece. Employees call HR asking why we aren't doing something about the abusers and they don't realize we are trying, but the unions make it so costly to manage that we sometimes throw up our hands in despair. If we don't accept insufficient medical for paid sick leave, we are often told we will have to spend thousands to go to arbitration, even though we know the issue has been previously decided. You give up and just pay the benefits since it's cheaper than going to arbitration. Some unions will send every sick note to arbitration. I try and tell our members that we should be thankful for our jobs, our wonderful benefits and if we don't act more responsibly, we are asking to be targets. Every public servant, whether teacher, nurse, truck driver, has a story of a coworker who is ruining it for everyone else, but they are silenced by their unions. I agree with one commentator that we should just beef up 'Employment Standards and get rid of the unions. Very sad."
"Every union contract renewal should start with a zero and build from there, same as with inventory. Not as it is at present : more money, less work variety than last year."
Plagiarists are barnacles on the state of journalism.
Fibulously good...
"When I worked in the Federal civil service, most people were never sick. We called the days we took off as 'Mental Health Days' and if anyone cares to check, they were taken off mostly to connect extra long weekends, holiday time, but certainly whenever it looked like the fish may be biting. And from my experience, most took every single day."
"Since no one was ever sick in your experience as a public servant, then zero is the right number of sick day?"
"Public service tasks need to be contracted out as much as possible. For example, bus routes can be privatized. Inspection services can be privatized. Building construction and maintenance can be privatized. Water systems can have their treatment plants an street services privatized. Hospitals already are somewhat privatized. All those steps to outsource reduces the overheads of goverment."
Greed has no bounds.'Inspection' services can NOT be privatized
"Only inspection services are federal responsibility in the examples you gave. And as has been pointed out, you don't want the inspection services contracted out."
"Well gee Marge - I agree that sick days are an issue, but to lump in those on disability and take shots at them is just shallow and callous of you. Taking the average of sick people and those on disability and lumping them together is a bit of a problem. When 1 on my staff was off for cancer treatments, she was off for 6 months on dissability. I suppose that would make it fair to say the other 6 people I employ are abusing their sick days because the average has skyrocketed. Of course, Marge is in perfect health and will never need the generosity of others. Typical G&M not asking questions about data before they write. I gotta stop reading her tripe."
"The one point that everyone misses on these articles is the fact that in the federal system, long term disability kicks in at a later date than most plans. Thus people that take 15 days off for a minor medical procedure take it all as sick leave and not a combination of sick and Long Term Disability. If your LTD kicks in at 5 dats then number of 'sick days' for a 15 day absence is only five days. This significantly increases the average number of days that a person is sick."
Problem is most workers don't have a pension or healthcare benefits let alone short and long term disability plans.
"So, joannie, one would presume the solution to that would be to find ways to have employees fund proper pension and benefit plans? Or are you the type that believe that, since 12% of Canadians are illiterate, we should eliminate reading programs in schools?"
"For a very brief period of time I worked as a consultant to the ON Minister of Housing just before and during the (thankfully) abreviated tenure of Bob Rae as ON Premier. His win was as much a surprise to the ON public service (of the era) as it was to any provincial tax-payer.The complete lack of 'work ethic' amongst all but the very newly hired was breathtaking to someone who had volutarily left a career in the financial services sector to do a stint of 'public service' as someone slightly more compensated than the WW1 'dollar a year person'. In retrospect, I can truly say that I wished I had been paid such a sum to completely overhaul how social housing in the province was funded. The commentator in the article is 110% correct in saying the system is designed to fail. Featherbedding is rampant, job descriptions are ludicrous, absenteeism is endemic, and everyone from the DM's, ADM's, and Directors on down are generally vastly over-educated for the skills that are demanded. In the early-mid '90's MBA's were very prolific in the mid and upper ranks of the ON MInistry of Housing, yet I could categorically state that none were needed! Why, because everything is political... all designed to make the government of the day look interested and attuned to the publics' welfare. Prior to becoming a consultant in social housing finance, I had 'gamed' the system to maximum advabntage for my (private sector) employer. We, and many others, made a very lucrative business of a 'programme' designed and endorsed by both Feds and the Provinces. I came to believe that the best type of programme at least in the social housing area, would be one designed by a 'genbius' to be operated by (tantamount 'idiots'...for that was all that the power and territorial bosses could handle. The public finances in this country will never reach a balance unless and until the powers of PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS are completely stripped away. After all, unions had their moment in sun, and that was before legislation mandated minutae such as bathroom breaks. What crap! Fire 25% at least of the incumbents (and perhaps they can learn to work for a living) and incentivize the balance for efficiency and cost reductions. Why is it that the public sector trade movement in at least ON was taken over my the discards of Margaret Thatcher's industrial revolution? a.k.a. Syd Ryan, etc..."
"' Prior to becoming a consultant in social housing finance, I had 'gamed' the system to maximum advabntage for my (private sector) employer. We, and many others, made a very lucrative business of a 'programme' designed and endorsed by both Feds and the Provinces.'--------------------------------So in essence, despite all of your holier-than-thou rhetoric, you were as much or more a parasite on the public purse as those you denigrate?"
What an a$$.
Sounds like you were the real parasite on the public of Ontario... and probably should have been prosecuted for your gaming activities. Another rational argument for not privatizing public sector functions. Thanks for sharing.
"approximately 70%, of the PS staff are women, so not difficult to understand sick leave requirements...."
"They hire disabled people, so I guess not unusual, that people are sick...."
I am touched by the concern expressed by the public sector unions.....when they claim that they are only concerned about the workplace and it's production....when discussing 'sick days'If one is so concerned.....as that they don't wish to further weaken the workplace by coming to work while sick... and spreading their illness....then that is good for the workplaceHow does the workplace improve when accumulated sick days are misused to extend stat holidays.. long weekends....take a monday and friday....because their 'sick days' wern't used to 'protect the workplace'I call BS......especially on a bloated....overpriced and unproductive public sector union arrangement
If you want to freeze ...and maybe lower the costs of Government. ....freeze all public service salaries/wages....review benifits... like every second Friday off... and accumulated sick days....Public service employees make two or three times as much as their private sector counterparts....Perks are just not defendable....You want taxes to stop rising... or even go down.....look at cost of public sector employees' wages and benifits... ENOUGHT !!!
They make 2-3 times as much as private sector counterparts? You've been reading too many CFIB handouts!
I haven't read a single 'race to the bottom' post yet on this one.. very interesting. If you union swine are afraid.. you should be. The people whom you have exploited are finally seeing the light... Get ready for the real world its gonna be a shocker!
"' Robyn Benson, president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada, told the Ottawa Citizen. 'It is not going to happen.'Let me fix that for you . . . .

"Public Sector Unionists have dug their own grave by demanding better wages, pensions, benefits and working conditions for themselves at everyone elses expense. 80% of us don't work for government and are bound by very basic labour legislation while paying for what are comparatively lavish benefits in the public sector. If public sector unionists believe these benefits are appropriate they should have lobbied for like pensions, healthcare, benefits and working conditions for all Canadians. Instead they backed political parties that pandered to their unions. We've been put into a position where public sector entitlements will have to be brought down to private sector averages before we can have an intelligent conversation about what we can afford to provide for all Canadians."
"Wow, who do you think are the ones most vocal in support of benefits and pension plans for ALL Canadians, joannie. That's right, those union goons! Who are the ones claiming nobody should have access to affordable pensions and benefits and should all pay for them at inflated individual prices on the open market or go without. That's right, those big business lobbyist like CFIB.. Joan, reform means to improve. Time to reform pensions and benefits to the betterment of ALL Canadians."
"Tell us, oh mighty dave, how a fully funded pension plan is unsustainable? Or, perhaps, you could explain how the massive increase in GIS and OAS obligations, increasing in direct correlation to the decline in DB pensions, IS sustainable. Have you and your house pet joannie ever been right about anything?"
"The massive increase in OAS is due to income splitting for those with high incomes in retirement and defined benefit pension. A $72,000 income in retirement still entitles one to full OAS."
"That is total nonsense, joannie! incomes splitting si a minuscule fraction of a percentage of OAS costs. You would know this if you were the pension expert you claim to be!OAS and GIS costs have multiplied in recent years, by the billions of dollars, in direct correlation to the decline in pension plan membership. Pension plans force you to save for your retirement every week, without exception. You know the stas about how much the average Canadian saves for their retirement in RRSPs (down from $12k a decade ago to under $60 today) and that's their total at retirement!. ALL of those people will be counting on OAS and GIS, unlike many with a pension, paid for from payroll deductions."
"Here is how they came about! The employers and the employees sat down at the table and recognised that, in retirement, those employees would still need mney to live. So they agreed to put aside a portion of their pay every week and put it into a pension fund that the employer would manage and use to pay the pensions. Some employers were more responsible with that money than others so the employers and employees sat down again and decides to jointly manage the plan. The same money would be deducted from the pay each week but they would state that half was the employer contribution and half the employee contribution, so that each would have equal say in how the money was managed. The employer made sure that the money was shared equally amongst the retirees and the employees made sure current employees paid their fair share. That's how they get to have pensions - it is funded by deductions from their pay every week. As for advocating for pensions and benefits for everyone, who do you think is doing that now? Unions are the only ones advocating fair pensions for ALL Canadians, same with benefits. Business lobby groups? Not. Pensions are an entitlement because they were paid for through weekly deductions from their compensation. Likewise with benefits. You can have the same, all you have to do is tell your employer to take a portion of your pay and put it into a pension(the employer contribution) and add more to teh pension from the remaining taxable income. But you won't - you want your entitlements to come, like joannie, as guaranteed government cheques paid from general tax revenues."
"Over time, the labour force in any bureaucracy will gradually become more expensive in relation to the work done. I suggest a systematic program of starting new ministries with all new hires and fresh labour agreements. Initially a new ministry has no brief, but gradually functions are transferred to it from older ministries, which can then be shut down. Most workers at the old ministry would automatically be laid off; only those with positive 360 degree reviews would be eligible to apply for jobs in other ministries. It's like in politics, where the real strength of democracy is less the ability to choose new leaders than the ability to turf out the old entitled reptiles."
"First, everyone has to understand that, while in the private sector it is the interests of the organization that are paramount, in the public sector it is the interests of the *employees* that are paramount. Once you understand THAT, you understand everything. I've worked in both environments, and speak from experience. Now, if you'll excuse me, I currently work for the feds and all this talk has caused me a lot of anxiety that necessitates me taking the next month or two off in sick leave to recover."
"One of the things that a great many people forget is that many of the things undertaken by 'government' have long time arcs. That is, from germ of an idea to full implementation, it may take 4, 5, or more years. When things take that long, continuity of staff is paramount, because you can't be constantly training up new people or bringing them up to speed on what has happened so far and why. I'll grant you that is not true of *all* PS jobs, but it is true of many. As such, the incentives to remain in place, as opposed to jumping ship for careers elsewhere, are not just perks, they are levers for getting the job done. That said, public servants often operate within a 'hurry up and wait' environment. Word comes from above that something is absolutely, terribly urgent, so you work on it, but then have to wait months on end for the many layers of approval and 'accountability' to work their magic before being able to take next steps. Within that environment, there can be many occasions where one is prompted to ask oneself 'Does it REALLY matter if I'm there today? Maybe it's better if I stay home today and show up in better form tomorrow.'.Finally, I don't think the sick day stats likely factor in all those times when people took sick days, but kept checking their work e-mail or voice-mail from home, just in case there was something that required their immediate attention. Incidentally, the new Workplace 2.0 standard, from Public Works, will have everyone working in smaller spaces, closer to each other, with minimal walls. The intent is to save on real estate costs, but you have to wonder what the impact on sick days will be when folks who ought to be home are seated 5 ft from each other and sneezing on each others' sandwiches."
"Unfortunately, beating up on public sector employees has become easy sport. Easy, because it is all too easy to do the calculations for the average shmo. It is easy to pick on the employee. The employee has no real power. For my part, I have worked in government and for large multinationals, to junior capital pool companies and in recent years have become an entrepreneur starting my own consulting firm which I have recently sold. In other words, I am capitalist! Needless to say I have seen the myriad of work place cultures and I can broadly speaking classify them into two broad categories. These are: Large organizations and small organization. Multinational and government for the most part have somewhat similar workplace environments in that they are typically hierarchical and heavily stratified with immense bureaucratic infrastructure. The bureaucracy is there by design to ensure that a disciplined decision making is adhered. Which also means these are not the most stimulating work environments around (be it government or large private companies). There are exceptions of course. There are no incentive available to government such stock options or stock purchase plans that offer employees an opportunity to get invested in the organization. And bonuses are generally quite paltry compared to large companies such as the financial , tech, resources etc.. So you need to have decent incentives. That does not mean that abuse should not go unpunished. And benefits such as sick leave, vacations etc. should be reasonable. However, so called toxic environments created through, neglect, mismanagement and downright incompetence on the part of management and not the employees. Speaking as a former employer of ten people, its is the responsibility of management to set the tone and to create the culture that they wish to have. In this case management are the deputy ministers of each federal department, and heads of all public sector unions. They are the ones who create the environment and that is where changes need to begin. Changes at this level ripple through the organization and that is how new work place cultures are achieve. New culture is not achieved through snipping the bottom of the org chart. Until, ministers and deputy ministers don't change their 'entitlements' and behavior around spending money nothing is going to change down the line at the lower levels. The lower levels take the liberties because management take the liberties. The public service provides vital work to us the 'Tax Payer' (I prefer citizen) and they should be respected for that. They do it without a possibility of getting rich which means they do it for service to the country. So I don't begrudge 'perks' that are not normally available in the private sector."
This post is far and away better and even handed than the original article. Quelle surpris...
it is long past the time for the government to cut back on these perks to the chosen. If we are to survive wages for the public sector should be frozen for five years and a no hiring policy should be in place for five years. by that time maybe civil servants will be up to working 80% efficient. anything less and we are screwed.
"Here's one that was missed, public sector workers who accumulate 300 days prior to retirement and suddenly get sick a few months before retirement and collect more that a year of salary before their pension kicks in. This happened to me many times as a senior executive in government . It is maddening and there is very little you can do as a manager to stop it from happening"
"So what is your point?? Aging employees who become ill, as we become more prone to do as we age, should be kicked to the side of the road and denied their sick leave benefits??"
"It's a challenge to engage employees as their careers wind down. But surely you're not suggesting this kind of activity is rampant, are you?"
Unions should simply be not allowed in the public system.
"Best, most concise, most accurate comment on this board."
"'Anti-union types, also predictably, say the government is full of freeloaders ripping off the system.' I sure it warmed Mag's cockles to pen that prose. Only what others are saying of course, not me, no not me, of course."
You can also say excessive executive compensation that have nothing to do with shareholder returns in publicly listed companies are barnacles on the ship of capitalism.
"You could. But then those bonuses to come out of MY paycheque, so not nearly the same thing."
Two wrongs don't make a right.
"Absolutely those bonuses come out of your paycheck, only it comes out of your net pay in the price of the things you buy. You know, stuff costs more in Canada over the US because of unnecessary import tariffs and because retailers / suppliers can get away with it."
"foley12: if you have a pension plan, if you own mutual funds or ETFs or individual stocks in your RRSP, in other words if you have any direct or indirect exposure to the stock market, those bonuses come out of your assets, and reduct the dividends that you would otherwise receive."
"in the US, whenever a raise in minimum wage is proposed, the people most antagonistic to the raise are - guess? - the folks one notch higher in the wage scale. my point is that folks like Wente etc find it ever so easy to point at folks they can see without an upward strain on their wee necks. Has Wente ever written a report on the half-trillion dollars rotting in corporate bank accounts? So what if the accumulation was done by hard graft - it is not circulating where there are needs, surely the main function of this artifice called money (did you know, they print the stuff? your bank prints the money for your mortgage (within some constraints)). Such an article would require research and thought, not a Wente strong suit. another lazy whack-the-lazy union bums article, fuelled by a weaker version of the cleansing simplicity that the Bolsheviks and brownshirts loved."
"Yes, half-trillion dollars rotting in corporate bank accounts is an issue. That doesn't negate anything in the article. Funny that you think it does,"
"It is self fulfilling, pile on the perks and you are guaranteed a vote. The unions are not going to elect themselves out of a job. This has turned into the ugly little monster that was somewhat predictable but politicians won't see it that way. As for the unions they have become power brokers and no longer serve their real intent other than to pass the cost on down. The system is broken and needs to be dismantled and rebuilt. Now the real challenge will be just who in the game of politics is ready to tackle that monster."
gonna take a girl or boy with big balls to put this fire out
"quote: 'The system is designed to invite abuse.'~~~~~~~~~~Then scrap the entire system & build a brand new one, WITHOUT public sector unions! That is simple enough. When our founding fathers wrote the constitution, where did they even mention that unions were suppose to be installed in gov't? Where?"
"There is no doubt that most civil servants are conscientious in fulfilling their jobs. But a large minority abuse the system. Claiming sick leave when not sick should be regarded as fraud, tantermount to stealing from taxpayers, and workers who do it should be fired with cause. The unions who support this abuse should be sued as accomplices. If you think this is harsh, remember most civil servants already have way more leave, work shorter hours and have more generous benefits than their equivalents in the private sector that pay their wages. It is an absolute disgrace that anyone should take further advantage of an already very generous package."
"I would be curious to see what the mean and median are, and the overall distribution of sick leave in terms of duration of each bout. One of my co-workers is battling Crohn's Disease and it, and the treament he is undergoing, can easily lay him low for a few weeks at a shot. Myself, I am rarely away for more than a day or two, with the exception of the 6 weeks I took off for bypass surgery. So overall sick leave use is a combination of both extended and brief bouts. And, given the average age of public servants, a large share will be dealing with extended bouts stemming from serious or chronic health problems. Twenty-five year olds may call in sick because of a hangover or cold. Fifty-five year olds are more likely to be using up sick leave in large quantities on hip/knee replacements, chemotherapy, bronchitis that just won't go away, or, as in my case, bypass surgery. When people make comparisons of sick leave use between public and private sectors, they have to factor in age demographics. Keep in mind that back in the budget conscious 90's, when so many public servants were laid off, the net result was that the average age of the PS went way up, because they cut way back on hiring young people."
If the benefits are appropriate the government should legislate like working conditions and benefits for all Canadians. Otherwise the 80% of us who don't work for government don't want to pay for entitlements we aren't entitled to.The Public Sector Unionists have shot themselves in the foot and lost the support of the public by not demanding what they consider fair treatment for all workers.
"The same benefits are available to all Canadians, joannie. All you have to do is negotiate to have a part of your pay directed into a pension plan (the employer contribution) and add more from your taxable income. All that you have to do for benefits is to negotiate with your employer to take a portion of your pay and have that directed into a group benefits plan that saves you the higher individual benefits cost. Didi you do that."
joannie_w: You need a union to negotiate those benefits.
"Isn't it funny how Scandinavian countries, with their far more generous and widespread unionized agreements, with much more benefits, sick leave, better pensions, etc., continue to purr along quite nicely, thank you very much. Meanwhile, the comparatively miserly union agreements in Canada are driving us into bankruptcy! BTW, those corporate tax cuts Harper arranged cost us $11.5 billion a year according to the parliamentary budget officer. And what did we get out of that? Oh, and who is the big lobby group constantly demanding the government cut union benefits? Why, the corporations, of course, in the person of the CFIB."
What's really funny is that you continue to use Scnadanavia as an example even as they try strip back some of these entitlements because they can no longer afford them .
"'And we found that something like 60 per cent of leave was taken adjacent to another leave [such as weekends or vacation time]'Okay, even if we ignore vacation time and stat holidays, at least 40% of working days do occur next to a weekend (Monday or Friday). Plus 'something like 60%' is not exactly rock solid language and there is no mention of the margin of error on this study so how egregious is the situation really? If we assume an even spread of sick days over the working week, 40% will occur next to the weekend, meaning the skew is only a matter of 20% which, while possibly still a problem, is not as devastating as 60% in the public perception... Further this whole discussion seems at cross purposes, decrying both those who use too many sick days and those who 'bank' them (thus not using them). If banking is a problem and is eliminated, you could probably expect to see more people use their allotment each year (sad but true to human nature when faced with use it or lose it). If using too many days is a problem, then those people not using the time (and thus banking it) should be lauded. There is no indication that they will one day decide to use it all up and will more likely see it go when they retire but, if they get 'lucky' and have to go for cancer treatments late in their career, they will at least have this time to fall back on, as a small reward for being hard working and not taking too many sicks days over the years..."
long term disability is not to be confused with sick days....Stick to the truth....don't use cancer patients as some human shield for a slack and unproductive public service....overloaded with perks
I guess it's time to get a note from your doctor.....if you want sick time.. I'm good with that....I don't take sick days unless I have to...and I can prove it
"under current rules, gov't sick days must be exhausted before one can go on disability and one must get a note from a doctor for more than two (or three?) days in a row. but, if you have the flu, you think you are going to be able to get to your doctor before you're recovered and back at work anyway? assuming you are lucky enough to have a doctor..."
"Does that mean that we can assume that the rest of the non-public service population who are without equivalent perks are either 'less sick' (not-likely in hell...), go to work sick hence likely making everyone else sick, go to work mentally challenged and stressed, or their jobs aren't stressful at all and never get sick or depressed. If that is the case we should do studies on non-public servants to find out what makes them so unique that they never get sick."
freedom 55(civil service0....I'm sure it can easily be docuemented how sickness effects workplace....public or private sector. Still if someone stays home and does not infect his/her workplace....THAT IS WHAT THE SICK DAYS OR FOR.....they are not bankable....if you don't need 'em...good for you ...you are owed nothing for being healthy ffs
not at all....the private sector workers just go to work on monday ...and stay there until Friday....regardless .Public sector 'workers' take a lot of monday and friday's off....'protecting the work place from the 'overindulgence and going to do it again.. flu'
"excellent article - most public servants do not appreciate how well off they are compared to the rest of us - not only is an attitudinal changed required in relation to their privileged position in the labour market, we need public servants at all levels of government in this country to manage the public purse as they (presumably) manage their private purses and that they work for and are accountable to the Canadian taxpayer...."
"Actually, we try to manage the public purse better than we manage our own private funds. If I blow money on a personal lunch, that's my business; if I don't get value on a contract, it's everyone's money. If I work late when it's not specifically directed for operational reasons, I pay for a cab out of my own pocket. And yes, I'm well aware that my benefits are better than people working elsewhere. I'm also aware that there would be big risks in moving away from a DB plan (e.g., the DG in Finance Canada who was making undeclared investments based on his insider information)."
"Some time back I took on several free-lance writing contracts at several different Federal government departments. On one contract, in essence I was expected to perform the work that an entire department had failed to produce with considerably more resources and time than they allotted to me. At the end of writing 30 stories in the span of six weeks I turned in the stories. After several months I contacted them to see if any have made it to print yet, so that I could add it to my portfolio. They had managed to lose them while they had been passing them around endlessly, awaiting approval. On another contract, the stories I was writing were supposed to be approved by a person immediately superior to me who had made a claim of having 'total allergy syndrome,' which prevented her from ever coming to work, but did not keep her from going to professional development seminars when they were held in posh hotels which required overnight stays on nice resorts. Without her signing off on the work, I could not be paid. It took two months to chase her down to a swanky resort where she was living the life of a rock star, before I finally obtained her signature. I don't know if she ever really worked on anything. After those two contracts, I decided that government work was too annoying to pursue. The Federal service is clogged with people who spend much of their day working out how best to exploit the system, and avoiding anything productive as if it was a contagious disease. We could lose half them and it wouldn't make any difference."
What dep't/agency hired you to write 'stories'? Is this one of your products? Because it sure sounds like fiction. Hunting down public servants on leave staying at resorts to get your paycheque? That's not very realistic.
You clearly have a gift for writing fiction . . .
"Besides, the woman you were hunting down would have someone act in her place."
"When I lived in Raibow Lake, AB, employees at the oil and gas plants would talk about doing literally nothing on their night shifts and being paid about double what I was earning as a teacher with half the education. I'm not to complain about my wages; I am well paid. But spare me the drival about how tough it is in the private sector in a place like Alberta. From my perspective, workers are workers. Some have it better than others. But its interesting how the fight is always to get the public sector to take less, irrespective of what ever cuts that sector had faced in previous years."
"OK, lets scrap the 5 day work week, paid overtime, maternity leave, equal pay for equal work, lets give managers' the authority to harrass sexually and otherwise without impunity, etc. I could go on and on. But all of us enjoy improved working conditions as a result of the union movement in Canada. Your draconian suggestion would be a disaster to working people government or otherwise."
"Putting aside how the entire compensation package compares between the private and public sector.... For sure, the benefits portion of the public sector package is superior. While the intent may be to improve working conditions and morale for the workers... the ultimate irony is that it seems to do instead create an entitlement culture. Morale in every public sector workplace I've witnessed is extremely poor. Anecdotally, it seems that trying to improve morale through compensation measures has the opposite effect."
You make a good point. Government employees typically have superior benefits and pensions. The trade-off is that they are also typically underpaid in comparison to private sector counterparts. The total compensation package needs to be taken into account before you start attacking just one aspect.
The problem with union workers is that they feel no loyalty to the one who pays their salary. Their alliance is with the union.. not all but many. And its easy to see who they are when you approach the counter. That said....the reason they use 18 day is because they believe its a 'hard fought right'...they don't see that its a benefit. I've worked in the public sector and its like clock work... one day every month you'd get a phone call in the morning from a very-sick-sounding-about-to-die-employee.........who fully recovers by 3:30 pm which coincidentally is quitting time.. and you'd see them at the gym or the mall etc ...
I work in the public sector and I haven't taken a sick day in 5 years. My compensation is about 2/3 of what someone in the private sector makes. My pension is much better but I have paid 9% of my wages for the last 34 years into it. No private plan has premiums like that. Make sure you get all your facts right before you start passing judgment.
"rock.. don't tell me to get MY facts straight!!! I know my facts. (you don't..so shut UP).Every CA is different, but that said IF you were only getting 2/3 wages compared to the private sector....I say BS!!!!!...and i challenge you to post LINKS to your CA (they are online)...and your position, and the years you worked.. and we can then say if you are BSing or not... and I say right now you are...!!!!"
I have never yet seen an employer who felt any loyalty to their workers; why would you expect workers to be loyal to their employers?
"I've read than once an employee has been shown to take 8 sick days per year they can be fired without ceremony for having breached their employment contract, which is that they will attend work and do their jobs for pay. Why doesn't government just fire them? Surely governmnent should pick a good case, fire the absentee employee and wait for the grievance hearing, which it would win. It would also strengthen gov.'s hand as it cuts these ridiculous sick days, which seem to amount to three week's holidays. However, most federal workers really do hate their jobs. Sick leave is abused almost as much."
"In future try reading things written by people who know what they are talking about. Here is a starter:'Long-term disability leave?how long is long enough?'xhttp://www.hrinfodesk.com/preview.asp?article=257267 (as usual, omit the leading x of the url)"
take off an average of 18 days a year because of sickness or disability ? more than twice as many days as people who work in the private sector and nearly three times more than people who work in small businesses. BECAUSE in the private sector people are FORCED to show up when sick. Been there...
"How is it B.S.? For a lot of private sector jobs, a day off sick is a day without pay."
".....For a lot of private sector jobs, a day off sick is a day without pay. Yes. As it should be. There is no Right to get paid for NOT working. Being paid for sick days is a PRIVILEGE not a Right. If you have not produced anything that your employeer can sell or use , why do you deserve to get paid ? Easy - YOU DON'T"
"'Being paid for sick days is a PRIVILEGE not a Right.'Cool. And as we enter this demographic age of labour force shortages, telling an employer that won't include sick days in their compensation package to fxxk off is a right too. Good luck to those employers who try to play that game....Good of you to have established where you stand on these issues though. Have a nice one."
"Oh, and the punch line: collective bargaining is a RIGHT (part of the right to free association), not a privilege."
"The PS's sick leave is not a 'perk', it is part of their compensation package. While some of us may covet this part of their compensation, remember that they go without other compensation elements that are common in the private sector. (Such as bonuses, free coffee, free parking, performance-based raises, etc). Picking on sick leave in isolation is completely arbitrary. The public service competes with the private sector for employees and this naturally causes a balancing of the compensation packages between them. Because they have very different approaches to compensation, an objective comparison is virtually impossible. I can confirm that the poisonous work environment theory for absenteeism is correct. Public servants are treated as if they should be kissing their desks everyday in thanks for the opportunity to work there, rather than being treated as valuable assets like employees of strong private sector companies are. This coupled with the highly centralized control of this government makes for a very negative workplace where this is little value placed in the efforts of public servants. Any private sector company would self-destruct under such circumstances."
"Wow, you have hit the nail on the head. I worked as a consultant for 13 years and took no sick leave except to have a baby and I was off for 5 months with no benefits... now I am a public servant and although the benefits are nice, they don't make up for the fact that I am not treated as a human being, rather a number in a box... I can't wait until I retire, wait a minute, I have been surplussed... I can't win... no wonder so many take sick leave!"
No Bonuses? What about bilingual bonus?
"Analog, $800/yr has been the same since the 50's when secretaries wanted something like what their EX's rec'd for performance pay. It hasn't changed since it was created."
"Say, Margaret - how much time did you take off work for your various hip replacements? I'm sure you consider that time well spent, but it seems you would not extend the same view to a civil servant..."
"In the private world the time required for a hip replacement would be considered extended leave and covered under short term disability insurance benefits, NOT sick days."
"and covered under short term disability insurance benefitsIF, IF you have those..."
I make a post with actual FACTS in it and so far 3 peple have 'disliked' it. Since when it disliking facts a part of rational debate ?
"91% of private sector workers don't have an employer based pension plan. Only 50% of Canadian workers have an employer based healthcare plan--many are very basic, some co-pay and some the employee pays. Contract work without the benefit of pensions, healthcare, benefits, EI, double the CPP payments and no protection of labour legislation is the fastest growing form of employment in Canada. Get off your entitled horse. We aren't paying anymore. Government employees deserve no more than what is dictated by norms in the private sector. Want to keep your entitlements? How much are you willing to pay in increased taxes to provide like pensions, benefits, healthcare and working conditions for all Canadians."
"'Government employees deserve no more than what is dictated by norms in the private sector.'Cool. Then government lawyers and economists win big, don't they. You're pulling numbers out that mix full-time professionals with part-time wait staff who have no benefits. What's the comparable percentages for comparable work? I bet you'd be surprised by how much you're saving as a taxpayer (i.e., by not paying market rates) if you did the apples-with-apples comparison."
"MMackinnon ,Your point and comparison is correct. Lawyers who work for the GoC (mostly at Justice) earn no where near what their private sector colleagues make. Why do they do it? Because they have more stability, more time off, get to spend their weekends out of the office, etc. Same thing with economists, nurses, MBAs, MPAs, etc. The only people who, on average IMO earn more than their private sector counterparts are the admin staff."
"Good, joanie, because YOU don't pay. You pay taxes in return for services. The government pays employees to provide those services. FROM that compensation are deducted the amounts that cover the pension contributions and the benefits. People get what they pay for. I pay for my pension and benefits through payroll deductions. Did your employer deduct a portion of your pay and put it into a pension plan. Well, if they did, then you deserve a pension, if not...."
ANy physician or specialist will put a block of time of six to eight weeks.....to deal with an 'uncomplicated ' hip replacement procedureIf infection is to be dealt with... that is another three months....It doesn't matter where you are employed that is what the time eliment is.I had a hip replacement procedure.. which I waited two years for... and when it was done... it became infected....and they had to rip the whole thing out and do it again......four months in allI had no public service package... and damned near lost my house.....and developed a tast for macaroni and rice....for the last two weeks. Public sector have no idea how the very people who pay them ..live...Like teachers....they have no empathy for their source of funds....THE TAX PAYER
"foley12: You are making a distinction without a difference. Sick leave is paid directly by the employer. Disability benefits, either short term or long term, are paid by an insurance company that is paid by the employer. Disability is actually the better choice for a junior employee, since the duration of benefits is usually not linked to length of service. A federal public servant with one year of service gets 15 paid sick days and no more, whereas if you have disability insurance you will be paid for the period specified by the policy, regardless of how long you have held your job."
"Dwight Steadman, we should fire you and ship you to India or China for employment!!!"
"I don't mess around in YOUR contract, don't mess around in mine. These aren't things we are stealing... they have been negotiated and signed by the employer (government). But, but....I pay your salary. Yeah, but I also pay a lot of taxes and that pays for your benefits too. And quit using terms like 'cash in' to inflame the debate. Sick days cannot be cashed out, nor can they be used to speed up retirement. This is allllll about jealousy. Why should someone get something I don't? Wah, wah, wah. Ever think that person worked hard to get an education, competed against tens of thousands of others to get that job and works hard in a thankless job where the public is always complaining and want to strip everything from you? And, p.s. What would you do if there was no one to 'serve' you? Who would issue your cheques, ensure your safety, improve the economy, keep things working?"
"Considering that your contract requires that you get paid money that is ripped out of MY paycheque, I have every right to voice an opinion on it.About jealosy ? Are you really that delusional? It's about the FACT that as a government worker your paycheque is coming directly from the paycheques of people making less than you."
"'It's about the FACT that as a government worker your paycheque is coming directly from the paycheques of people making less than you.'Foley, PS workers and those that make less are all part of the 99%. :)Hospital CEOs, and anybody else in the 1% are also contributing to PS workers' paycheque."
"@wjserson. I find it odd that you think you have made some sort of point, cuz there aint one in there."
"foley: It's about the FACT that my paycheque is coming out of the paycheques of people making MORE than me too, as well as the FACT that it's coming out of the paycheques of people making EXACTLY AS MUCH as me too. Does that make it clearer for you?...And putting it in all caps doesn't really make it look any smarter, does it....In general, we pool our tax dollars so that we, as a society, can achieve things that we couldn't pay for individually. And yes, as a citizen, you have every right to insist on value for your taxpayer's money as part of that deal. But really, do you think every possible Public Service job should make at or less than the median wage across the Canadian population? Do you want to stop attracting any qualified professionals to the Public Service (since there's no way that any sane economist, or lawyer, would ever take a Public Service job under those conditions)? That's the implication of what you're saying there. Yep, this really is about jealousy. You're just plain stupid if you want to insist that no Public Servant out there makes a dollar more than you do."
"Bull Droppings . Enter the real world and find out what work , commitment , and sacrifice is all about . After you conquer those challenges you can then share in the sense of real self esteem that productive , worthy and tax paying citezens have . They also so pay your over compensated butt ."
"[Looks up] Wow -- don't see any poster up there named 'Bull Droppings' -- you must be in the wrong thread....But since you are here, feel free to explain how deciding to work to serve your country doesn't constitute commitment and sacrifice. And don't tell me that there's no self-esteem inherent in ensuring the best policies, programs and services are there to serve my fellow Canadians. Compensation is determined in part by the market, in part by negotiations in collective bargaining. And, as I've said elsewhere in this thread, collective bargaining is a right."
"Foley, my point is that public servants may be making more than you, but not more than all tax payers (which you implied).I'm not sure what you do for a living or if you work at all, but your statement is not a FACT. Public servants don't get their salaries from only those making less than them. There are plenty of Canadians making more that pay tax too."

"'We did a pattern analysis of when people took their sick leave,' Mr. Graham recalls. 'And we found that something like 60 per cent of leave was taken adjacent to another leave [such as weekends or vacation time]. But the union objected, and we had to stop doing it.'----------------------------------------Andrew Graham is a retired Assistant Deputy Minister and currently an adjunct professor of management. A smart man like that must have looked into this analysis carefully as part of his management duties. I mean, he's not a pointy-haired Dilbert boss, right? With nine statutory holidays for federal civil servants the incidence of uniformly (or randomly) distributed work days adjacent to a weekend or holiday is as follows: single day: 42%two consecutive days: 53%three consecutive days: 72%four or more consecutive days: 100%Making the not unreasonable assumption that single-day sick absences are twice as common as two-day ones, four times as common as three-day ones, and eight times as common as longer ones, then the expected proportion of uniformly distributed absences falling adjacent to a weekend or holiday is... 61%. Oops. Mr. Graham's analysis is looking just a little shoddy. I hope his is not a reflection of the standards to be found in the ranks of his peers."
"Good comment. Although i don't fully understand the math, I get what your geting at."
"PSAC federal days off employee benefits:- 18 sick days a year- 5 family days per year - For appointments, recitals or school trips- 2 mental health or vonlunteer days per year- 5 days for bereavement- 5 days for your marriage- every statutory holiday is paid (12 days min.)- weekendsThere is probably more but I'll leave it to someone else."
"18 days is average including LTD which is 2 yrs + 15 weeks. Sorry if a cancer patient on LTD is considered robbing the public purse. If you want he can use EI instead or is that wrong to use too!!! Really, having weekends off is a public perk? How about people on welfare, disability, OAS, public housing, baby bonus etc... are all these not entitlements that the private get that the public doesn't get, but pays for it through taxes. At least you get a service for what you pay for whereas what I mentioned above is a good social benefit but it doesn't produce a service or product. Entitlements all around."
"So what? It was negotiated. Good for them. You should/could have benefits like these, but you spend your energy running others down. Try supporting people and running them up, pay-it-forward, and you might live in a better, wealthier, healthier society. Stop being a jealous slave."
"You're mixing annual entitlements (not all of which are used) with once-in-a-lifetime ones (the marriage leave) with the average number of sick days taken (skewed by long-service employees who are really ill). You've mixing apples and kittens, there. The volunteer day is a policy choice by the government to encourage support for local charities. As a manager, I always asked any team members who requested the volunteer day the name of the organization they were volunteering for."
Use your vacation time to get married. These entitlements are beyond the pale.
'Use your vacation time to get married.'Right up there with quit your job to have a baby. Thought we had moved past that.
"Joannie likes the 1700s. Back in the good old days when you were paid in coal and had a vacation day once a year. In her small mind, if one person has no benefits, nobody should have benefits. If one person is blind, lets poke everyone's eyes out."
The simple facts are that public sector employment traditionally paid less than the private sector but the payoff was better job stability and more security. Now public sector workers believe that they should also have higher (or at least equal to) the private sector but they do NOT want to give up their job security and their perks. The ratio has gotten out of whack.
"'Now public sector workers believe that they should also have higher (or at least equal to) the private sector but they do NOT want to give up their job security and their perks.'Cite? Proof that this is even a daydream, let alone a trend?"
Google CFIB Wage Watch. Average value of compensation packages in the public sector for same work are 25-42% higher. The study was compiled by Statscan based on the 2006 census.
...And the CFIB is an entirely balanced source with no axe to grind whatsoever on the issue....
"CFIB wage watch is the most biased piece of nonsense - even CD Howe mocks it. They did not take into account any factors such as education and experience, skipped any position where they knew the numbers would count against their preconceived agenda, and much more. Nobody should base any opinion on that report alone, nor any report from a union alone, without comparing sources and doing some background research. Facts and balance have no place in little joannies world."
"You have a lot of excuses, MMackinnon but no truth to back you up."
Keep in mind that these bonuses were introduced by the Harris Conservative government to foster better initiative and efficiency. Bonuses have not been a staple of civil service remuneration.

Their positions couldn't take more than three hours to re fill
"'public-sector workers [are] typically allowed to bank their unused sick days for years to come and cash them in whenever they feel faint.''Their banked sick leave alone amounts to a $5-billion liability.'Wrong on both counts. Sick leave more than a few days can not be taken on a whim, and any extended absence requires certification of proof of illness from a doctor. This is why banked sick leave does not represent a large liability to the government. Public servants typically retire with many hundreds of days of accumulated sick leave that they have not used, and can not use, because they are not seriously ill. And I can say that in my case, I have some 1200+ accumulated sick leave. When I retire in a few years, I will very likely have even more days of accumulated sick for which I will receive (and expect) nothing. There is no liability to the government here."
"Sick leave more than a few days can not be taken on a whim, and any extended absence requires certification of proof of illness from a doctor. ____________________________________ It is rare to find a doctor who will NOT err on the side of caution and sign a note on just about any pretext for short term leave."
"This is why banked sick leave does not represent a large liability to the government. _______________________________________ This is simply incorrect. You may be part of the majority, but it is quite obvious from the statistics that there is a very large contingent of workers who take double the sick time that private workers do.And in governement, these workers are often (but not always) replaced with part time workers. That is the 'hidden' expense."
They still have to account for it on the books. It's the law.
I have been with the same company for 20 years. I am 'allowed' 6 six days per year. I average 1.25 sick days per year.
Hilarious how some people have 'disliked' Blakdann's post. Nothing more funny than when people dislike facts. I could post 2+2=4 and some leftist would 'dislike' it
"'You may be part of the majority, but it is quite obvious from the statistics that there is a very large contingent of workers who take double the sick time that private workers do.'Or there is a handful with significant chronic diseases who push the average up and without whom the average would look pretty similar to that of the private sector with benefits....As opposed to the part-time wait staff with no benefits at all, who drag down the private sector average...."
"It is rare to find a doctor who will NOT err on the side of caution and sign a note on just about any pretext for short term leave. __________________________________ Funny that people do not like the truth, but it is. The problem is that as an employer, do you force a staff member to go to the employers doctor for an independent analysis? Simply not worth it for short term illnesses."
"The last time I heard, the federal paid sick leave allowance was 15 days per year. So Muzzled, you have been working for more than 80 years without taking any sick leave?"
"An acquaintance of my family recently went on sick leave for one year - and then retired from the federal civil service. He took advantage of his unused sick leave. While I despise this action , I am more concerned about the high risk that his kids and grandkids will inherit this disgusting work ethic."
Nope..... that never happened. I know because the other unionists here told us so.
"I am the only one (unless my scan was poor) saying (9:10 AM on March 21, 2013) that it is the cost of the total pay package which should be discussed. Anything else is interfering in how public servants spend their money. Why is anybody interested in that?"
Exactly. And the cost of a government employee should be based on average compensation for similar work in the private sector. Problem is public sector compensation is bloated compared to.
"'Problem is public sector compensation is bloated compared to.'Proof? Good luck making this sweeping generalization stick, in particular with the public sector lawyers and economists."
"Banking sick days is the more ridiculous thing I have ever heard of. If you're not sick, count your blessings rather than your sense of entitlement! Policies such as this is exactly why unions have a bad rap. It's abuse."
"Totally agree with you. I think banking was put in place to discourage people from using all their sick days over the course of the year. The logic being that if people knew they would disappear, they'd use them all. Funny though, I think this just encourages people to come to work sick and infect their colleagues."
"In the federal public service, sick leave can be banked, but cannot be cashed out. And a medical certificate is required for more than 3 days. Someone who is abusing their sick leave in this environment is likely to use all or nearly all of it each year. The only way someone having large amounts of banked sick leave is ever going to use it is if they have a serious illness or accident."
"w_smith, Furthermore, once the sick days are all used up for the fiscal year (by those employees who need a Monday or Friday off every week), their sick days quickly become 'no pay' days."
"'Funny though, I think this just encourages people to come to work sick and infect their colleagues.'I've seen this from two posters now, and I have to ask again: how? How does being able to bank them encourage you to come in even though you're sick?...Like, as opposed to not having sick days, which really does encourage you to come into work despite being ill...."
"Banking sick days is entirely sensible. There is nothing magical about a one-year period, nor is one year's worth of sick days enough in the event of a serious illness. Instead of thinking of the sick-leave allowance as 15 days per year, try thinking of it as 150 days per decade, or 450 days per thirty years. If, for instance, a public servant works for 15 years without ever taking a day of sick leave, but is then diagnosed with cancer and has to be off work for six months for surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, I can see no reason why he should not be paid for up to the whole 15 years worth of sick leave. If you deny people the right to bank sick leave, you deny them the right to be seriously ill."
The reason sick days can be banked is because there is no short-term disability. The sick days are the short-term disability.
Banking sick days is OK to protect otherwise healthy workers from the effects of a serious long-term illness. Cashing out the sick days is another matter. I can agree with banning the cashing out of sick days.
"There is no reason for any public sector benefits to be higher than what is provided under labour legislation. If labour legislation is insufficient then change the labour legislation for everybody. No more two tier pensions, healthcare, benefits and working conditions for public sector employees."
joannie_w: Labour legislation provides for minimum wage. Are you suggesting that e.g. deputy ministers should work for minimum wage?
if we had a vibrant functional economy we would not be talking public sector cuts
"But Margaret absenteeism is up everywhere. Thats due to a number of factors - aging parents, more women in the workforce with family responsibilities, more stress at work. You make it sound like Public Servants (in the Federal Public Sector they number almost 300, 000) are out of work lolling about eating bon bons. How many of those people are really ill? Or have to take time off to deal with family issues? I am a retired Public Servant who had hundreds of days banked when I retired. Thats because I was rarely off. Before going into the Public Service I had worked in the private sector - with no sick leave. So when I was off, I lost my pay. I was a single mother with no other income but what I earned. So when my kids were ill - which was also rare (thank goodness) or I had to take them to their annual physical or go to my own annual I lost pay. And you think this is a good thing? I had over 150 staff in my last Public Service job and I can honestly say that I did not see any abuses. If they had a real reason for being off we assumed they should be off. They were treated as adults not like someone trying to game the system. I dunno why public servants are always assumed to be slackers who get too much for too little. I can tell you that I worked my tail off for what I made. As did my colleagues. We earned what we made and the some. In the senior ranks the midnight oil burns nightly. We were the first to arrive in the early hours and stay late into the evening. Thats just part of the job. There has been low morale for some time and as the government/Minister/Deputy Minister of the day changes so change the rules under which we work. Its a job in constant transition at the whim of whomever is 'running the show'. We are under constant pressure to meet the demands of that Minister and his/her office at a moment's notice. Sometimes with unrealistic expectations to a deadline that would make anyone 'sick'.A Conservative government has traditionally loathed Public Servants as they assume most are closet Liberals. So they go about the business of playing to their own base by cutting jobs and imposing tougher and tougher sanctions. All designed to show their public how they've taken on those Ottawa fat cats. Funny thing is - many of those same Public Sector jobs are held by Conservatives in their own ridings. Many of whom entered Government 'service' because they believe in the work and love what they do. Too bad we rarely get the opportunity to express that and instead have to read articles like this one about how we are sucking off the public 'teat'. Nothing could be further from the truth."
"'In the senior ranks the midnight oil burns nightly'Baloney, and I know about this."
"ManCityFC: If you think its 'baloney' then you must have already left for home when the senior executives are still working. They are most often in the evening hours either still at the office or at home working from their blackberry. I know, I did it for years. You simply don't like Public Servants/the Public Service."
"The longer the public service employee works inside the bubble, the more remote and removed he or she becomes from the real world, and is not meant as critizism its just reality."
"Just a couple of quick points... Teachers are not federal employees. PSAC etc workers do not get paid out on unused sick time accumulated. We don't 'own' federal employees any more than we 'own' a Walmart (or any other private sector) employee just because we purchase their goods and services. As with most work environments, the goodness, badness and ugliness begins at the top. It's been said that any employer who has a union shop probably deserves it."
theopublic service sector is overpaid... under supervised.. and unaccountable. most of the folks who send taxes into ANY and all levels of government have nowhere near that kind of money nor lifestyle.. Get out of your bubble... and have a good look around on who supports our country. It sure isn't the civil service.....more like vultures who live off the cattle ...cattlemen produce the cattle.. pay the tax... and still have to feed you parasites too

"So if you have a bad year, the weather's not good or the world price for your food commodity isn't as high as you wanted, you don't take government money? That's the same taxpayers cash you want cut back.

Unions for monopoly services ???? Give your head a shake......Whoever came up with this idea should be imprisoned for life...
"It's not just civil servants who abuse sick leave. Mental illness is the new bad back. The biggest trend in Ontario is for people to go on ODSP by claiming to be bi-polar, depressed or suffering from anxiety so you can double your income and not be badgered to work. The only victims are people who really suffer from these illnesses, never take time off work and hide it from everyone so they are not tarred with the same brush."
"How would that double our income? Th3ere is no question that more people are being diagnosed with these issues, at school and at work. Which comes first, though? Is stress being caused by insecure working environment, perhaps? Are the increases in diagnosis a matter of doctors being more aware of the symptoms or a matter of the infrastructure making it easier and more profitable for doctors to simply make the diagnosis and push the pills? You are quite correct in stating that, in many cases, those who do suffer from these issues often hide the fact, for various reasons. And, you are correct that these issues are global, not specific to any sector. There are those who would argue, however, that people - those who genuinely do suffer from these conditions - may be more likely to come out and seek help in the public sector for the simple fact that theycannot be fired for doing so, as they can in the private sector (of course, in the private sector they will not fire you for being sick, that would be illegal, but they will find other ways to 'get rid of the problem' through attendance issues, creative measures (unfortunately, we are reorganising your department and, well, you are the one we have to let go)...."
The definition of anxiety in the psychiatrist's Manual of Mental Disorders use to be two sentences long. It's now over two pages and encompasses anything that could be attributed to normal human behaviour. It's our entire society that is sick and wimpy.

All these wastes of taxpayer dollars, and the cost of using road-repairing Tarsands (Bitumen) to our cities? Went from $400 per tonne as bitumen, to $800 per tonne as oil material?)Sure! knock down the waste in the Public Service, but don't cut them down to Minimum Wage shmucks, like the rest of us, in other industries. Somebody qualified needs to run the Pirates Of The Canadian, in Ottawa."
One problem at a time please. Five wrongs don't make a right.
The (union) copy editor doesn't know the difference between 'lightening rod' and 'lightning rod'? We're supposed to pay for the Globe and accept sloppiness?

Likely has more to do with lack of revenue and an over worked editor
"After 16 years with the federal government, I have banked 32 weeks of sick leave, meaning I have used about a week a year on average. When I retire, this usused leave with simply vanish, costing the government nothing. My observation has been that most retiring public servants work until their last day and do not use the sick leave to illegitimately 'move up' their retirement date. As a public servant, I would gladly trade my ability to bank sick leave with the ability to have unused leave cashed out at the end of a year, like many of my friends in the private sector who work in similar jobs for similar pay. Perhaps Ms. Wente can tell us a bit more about how sick leave works in the private sector to help us understand what is so much worse with the public sector approach."
As a gov't employee I don't know how many times I've been at work and people are sneezing and hacking their germs around. I'm sure it happens in the so called 'efficient' private sector too. Show up or else. I know the issue is the suspected gov't employee calling in sick when they may not be. As the gov't has shifted from more front line workers to more top level policy makers the average seems to be near the top. Gov't math anyway.
"Personally, I love it when the people behind the counter are sniffling and coughing their way through the day because they don't have sick days. Invest in hand sanitizer, share prices are going to rise."
"I agree with Wente on this one. The system is abused. I worked in the federal civil service and retired with 150 days of unused sick leave. Didn't want to play the game of going to get a doctor's slip to say I was 'sick' for the last 150 days of my civil service career. A much bigger issue has to do with lazy and incompetent federal employees that rarely get disciplined and never get fired. What Wente said about the inability of managers to 'manage' their work force is very true...'When managers are thwarted at every turn from managing their work force, they give up. If it's almost impossible for them to discipline or fire people, they won't.' I had a manager like that... should have never been a manager in the first place, but several employees ran completely roughshod over him (and the rest of us, by default). These clown wouldn't last a week any where else in the private sector workforce. That is a terrible way to try to work and a poisonous work environment."
"As you worked inside the system, your knowlege should carry a great deal of weight with any-one with-out a closed mind. Nice read."
"First order of business ought to be to scrap their pension plans. and let them cobble together what the other 90% are forced to do. Then axe the family day comedy entirelyalong with any and all benefits that exceed the private sector reality. The truth is if the conditions are so inherently bad there's always the option to work elsewhere as no one is holding a gun to their head nod forcing them to stay. I'm sorry, there might well be hard working public servants but in general it's a sea of slackers and whiners. where many might well be employed but far too few actually work."
"Sure, as you point out, the way that the rest of Canadians have to try to save for their retirement is expensive, difficult and insecure. So, clearly, the best solution would to make the public servants and all others with DB plans suffer like everyone else! Or, just maybe, we should see why it is that these people ARE able to retire with a secure retirement income and try to build that model so ALL Canadians can have the same opportunity. Perhaps it would be better to have everyone pay into a pension plan every week without exception, have the employer take away a portion of the compensation and pay that directly into the pension plan (the employer contribution) and pay in some more from the taxable income. Doing away with pension plans is the opposite of what is needed. If you believe (and if data were to support the idea) that PS compensation is too high, then cut the base salary but the LAST thing to cut would be the pensions. Saving for retirement is the best thing and should be mandatory for ALL Canadians, preferably into a plan that costs 0.5% per year to operate versus 2.5% for most retail retirement savings options."
"Until we provide like pensions, benefits, healthcare and working conditions for all, DANDON is right."
"...Oh, and the federal public service doesn't get family day. Those with families have to burn a vacation day to look after their kids because the provincially-run schools are closed."
"So, joannie, if these benefits and pesnions are so good, why are you advocating for their elimination rather than fighting for these benefits for yourself. We all know why - you don't want to pay for them as we do, from weekly payroll deductions. As you haves stated, you want a guaranteed pension for everyone (i.e. yourself) paid from general tax revenues and business tax. There is only one DB plan you approve of - CPP, which you happen to pay into. How unselfish of you!"
"I've oftentimes wondered why they call it the Public Service or Service Canada, when there is no service. Sadly, every dealing with government is frustrating and it takes a request to speak to a supervisor to get something done. Unfortunately, I've had to file a number of formal complaints but it is amazing how the system reacts once it is held to account. You could fire half the people in government and there would be little improvement in service. Hopefully this budget will be the start of change."
"Nice anecdotes. I've always recieved excellent service from public service staff, whereas corporate staff continually lie, deliberately omit key information or keep you in call waiting hell for hours. In either case, the service you recieve often depends upon whether you treat people with appreciation and respect. Bob, try being less hostile, your anger is self-defeating."
"I agree... all unions should be banned from municipalities, provincial and federal levels!"
You can't ban unions.
"Real Canadian 10:13 AM on March 21, 2013 : 'There should be no public service unions at all.'Which is interesting, as unions come into being/exist when the employer is deemed 'unfair' to workers. BUT since the employer is the government (what were they trying to do? Maximize profits at the expense of the workers?), this raises an interesting paradox. These boards are full of people who advocate more public ownership of everything from resources to manufacturing. But why would you want to expand the reach/power of an organization that is conclusively a poor employer, evidenced by its' much higher rate of union membership?"
There should be no public service unions at all.
Then who would decide what is fair and how would they do it? The most efficient system for negotiating compensation for both employees and employers where employee numbers are large is the free collective bargaining process.
"The market would decide, just like it does in the private sector. Since we have a multitude of labour laws now that were not in place in the 1930s when unions were born, this won't be as big a problem as you think."
"Okay, so since a lot of the work/functions the civil service provides really has no private sector equivalent, what 'market' gets to decide?"
"If you want the market to decide, get ready for some whopping big increases to government salaries."
I needed a union to tell my manager that her way of assessing my work was faulty.

"60% of sick leave adjacent to another leave, like weekends. Let's see....of the five work days, two are adjacent to weekend days, so we would expect at least 40% of leave to be adjacent to weekends, at random. And it is actually 60%?? And that's worth outrage over, and a newspaper article? And the article was about differences in public sector vs private, but doesn't give the stat for private sector? (We know it will be at least 40%...)"
"Maggie's article is conveniently, and perhaps deliberately, misleading. At no time can federal employees 'cash out' their leave. They can accumulate it, but frequently retire with 200-300 days in the bank. (People typically save up their leave for when they are older and need it.) Worth bearing in mind that employees can only take 3 days without a medical certificate. There are at least four key things wrong with the federal public service that have destroyed morale:- constant cut-backs that mean continually having to do more with less;- a nauseating culture of political-correctness that stifles genuine debate and dissent; - social-engineering hiring practices that have effectively decimated the merit principle; and, - a ridiculous climate of hyper-accountability that destroys risk-taking, innovation and originality. Combine that with a culture of hypocrisy that talks people-management but continues to hire sociopaths and you get the picture. Young people would do well to stay away. Dante said it all, 'Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here'."
"I worked for 10 years for the federal government. You nailed it.Not that the claims of the article are without merit, as some employees did milk the system and as a manager I could do nothing formally about it.I think the conditions you described contribute to many longer-term employees behaving poorly out of bitterness and revenge."
200 to 300 days in the bank ?????You just don't get it do you ??Reason sick days were agreed to was the bit about coming to work sick... and taking out five or six more of your workmates....It made economic senseThe way it has been deployed... is the 'sick days' are 90% on a friday or monday.. or before or after a stat or long weekend....or prior to retirement... maybe a year and a half ffsand in advance of individual's holidays.....can you spell ABUSE....and as for 'banking' sick daysnot what was agreed to initially at all. This is systematic abuse by employees unions....and is one of the most blatant causes for shipping jobs off shore... or contracting them out of public sector formats
"As always, loose with the facts. But then for rider, ideology trumps reality"

"We could easily outsource a lot of public bureaucratic paper-work to China and India where employees work cheaper and more accurately. Routine stuff like, issuing passports, driver's licence renewals, birth certificates, even some Canada Revenue correspondence could all be done remotely at a fraction of the cost. It's just a prejudice to say this kind of work has to be done by Canadians in Canada - if you can get the same performance at a quarter of the cost - why not?"
excellent idea! Just what Canada needs: more unemployment.
"Genius idea dwight, let's put China and India in charge of our security. Heck, let's import some Chinese police officers and skip a step. (Just keep in mind, they used to send a request for payment of the cost of the bullets used in executions to the family of the executed.)"
My company has used Indian outsourcing from time to time for some aspects of the work we do. Yes it's cheaper but not any more accurate and sometimes worse.
"This is part of the problem and we must put a stop to it.Unless of course we want a race to the bottom. I publish endlessly about the disparities between public and private sector employment in this country. Governments have no business using our tax dollars to provide better pensions, benefits, healthcare and working conditions for public sector workers than what they are willing to provide or legislate for all. That said, let's decide what is appropriate for all."
"posting on a discussion board is not to publish, joannie! You used to claim your were a pension expert who had written extensively on the topic until we realised that you didnt know the difference between debt and deficit! Government uses tax money to pay their employees. FROM that compensation the employees negotiated to have a portion of their pay paid into a pension plan so that they could retire with a secure pension. To say you pay for public servants pension is like saying you paid for the salesman's car when you bought your sofa. You paid for the sofa. the employer paid the salesman for his work. The salesman paid for his car. Did you negotiate to have a portion of your pay put aside for your retirement."

"With the present system it is extremely difficult to fire anyone. The perks are far too generous and must be changed soonest. To save more money politicians must get a very small pension compared to now and not get any money until age 65. Their other retirement home, the Senate, must also be scrapped and until the legislation goes through pay them minimum wage."
"Ok, public servants feel sick and take time off and return when they're better. Private sector workers feel sick, go to work and spread it around so everyone is sick and productivity goes down. There will always be people who take advantage of a system. I always find it amazing (and I shouldn't be surprised any more) that the rank and file workers are the easiest to blame and the ones to pick on. Are they expected to not have any perks while their managers, bureaucrats and politicians are entitled to their entitlements? I think not. Let the upper ranks of government set the example instead of just picking on the little guy. Get rid of useless appendages like the Senate, let MP's with their high salaries pay for their own accomodations and transportation when they're away from home and pay their own travel expenses on their junkets abroad. I think things would change very quickly."
you have stratistics and facts to back this up ....right ??...or are you one of those public sector parasites who want to bank sick days....when you don't need them. My dad had his own family drug store... last of his kind.....mortgaged his soul in 1955... and moved to a small city in Saskatchewan... He never had a Christmas dinner with his family....as someone would phone and needed a prescription filled....He and his fabulous wife worked hard ...and it succeeded....You want financial independance.....get into business ownership......not suck up tax payers money so you can retire at 55 with 'defined benifits'..due to perfect attendance
"My dad had his own family drug store... He and his fabulous wife....If thes story were real, and written by one with a little intelligence, you would have written something to the effect of 'he and my wonderful mother/stepmother...'But, for rider, truth has always been an inconvenience."

"Some more fun with statistics We are given the absolutely shocking statistic that 60% of the sick leave occurrences are adjacent to a weekend or holiday. Well lets think about this. If we assume that each case of sick leave is a single day randomly taken during a week, the expected result is 40%. If sick leave is taken for more than a single day at a time, this will push the statistic up further. And if the existence of holidays will push it up still further. There is probably some cheating going on, but not to anywhere near the extent that is implied."
"Here is the funny, mocking version. xhttp://search.dilbert.com/comic/40%25%20Sick(omit the leading x)But given a chance I'll see if I can run that against a list of statutory holidays. Since as you correctly note a minimum of 40% would be expected for single random days (Monday and Friday) the expected levels when including holidays and multiday absences can only go up. 60% is not unreasonable, and can be modeled. To clarify, Graham is an adjunct professor at Queen's School of Policy Studies, not a full-time tenured faculty member."
"With nine federal statutory holidays the breakdown for randomly distributed sick days adjacent to a weekend or holiday is as follows: single day: 42%two consecutive days: 53%three consecutive days: 72%four or more consecutive days: 100%Making the not unreasonable assumption that single-day absences are twice as common as two-day ones, four times as common as three-day ones, and eight times as common as longer ones, then the expected proportion of absences falling adjacent to a weekend or holiday is... 61%."
True. I know somebody that was truly sick on a Friday ........once. But then there were the other 9 Fridays he called in sick .....from the beach
"Foley, me too. She would take a Monday and/or friday off every week and call in sick. Then she ran out of sick days and took unpaid sick days. Then she went on sick leave and has been gone for over a year."
"I cannot begin to count the number of times I have come home healthy but a little tired on a Friday afternoon, felt like feces on toast come Friday evening, spent the entire weekend in bed, working my way through boxes of facial tissue and teabags, asked myself whether I was *really* up to going into work Monday morning, and finally decided that there was no point in slugging it out for one day, only to be laid low for the rest of the week when there was work to be done. Now, on paper, I looks like I took a 3-day weekend. Of course, it was absolutely nothing of the sort. Believe it or not, people actually DO get sick on Fridays, and can actually still BE sick on Mondays. It happens."
"MP Hammer, I apologize if I sounded insensitive. I've had those days too. But this person was very methodical in using her sick days until it stopped working to her advantage. Then she left, took 70% of her salary with her. If this is the type of problem the GoC wants to deal with, I'm all for it. If they're looking at cracking down on the people who sometimes require a bit of time off, then they're going to far."

"wjserson, Yes, people like that exist. Do they exist in the sorts of numbers that warrant overhauling an entire collective agreement that affects a substantially greater number of people? It becomes a bit like deciding to overhaul Parliament, for the sake of one errant MP.You know, when a government runs out of ideas, it is child's play to start going after 'cheaters'. Like shooting fish in a barrel, really. The public will respond to it every single time. It's the sort of reflex, the vision-deprived leader can always turn to for results. Some researchers (see Cosmides and Tooby) have gone so far as to propose evolved neural circuits for 'cheater detection'.I can see putting a cap on sick leave that can be carried over. Personally, I presently have 839hrs banked, and I can't honestly see myself ever needing to have more than 300-350hrs at my disposal. Heck, even when I went for a triple bypass, I only needed 225hrs for full recovery. So if someone wanted to propose a reasonable lifetime, or annual-use, cap I'd have no quarrel with that."
The scraping of barnacles starts today. Tax payers will be satisfied when all of these ridiculous perks are gone and the free loaders in the public service are cut lose. This only applies to 10 - 15 % of the total work force but once that is dealt with we will have a much improved attitute in the employees left and the drain on the tax payer will be lessened.
What the heck! Why don't we just impose slave labour on the government worker wretches!
"One thing that should be pointed out is that, it is basically illegal to reject a candidate for a public service position (or find a pretext to fire them) because of their health problems. Furthermore, I understand that there are circumstances where ex-military are given preference and that at least a proportion of these involve people leaving the military due to health problems. These situations undoubtedly skew the statistics. On the other hand, most of these people would otherwise show up under other programs such as long term disability or EI."
Yet the INDIVIDUAL Corporate CAO's on Bay Street earning multi-milliions annually on the backs of shareholders (who are also taxpayers) are not lumped in with these barnicles? Great one-sided analysis of our labour problems.
CEOS of corporations are also abusing the 'system' and need to be reined in ... who said the private sector was perfect ?
"Shareholders get a choice in which companies they will own and which they will not. If they are unhappy with the management of the company, they don't have to buy it. If they do buy it , they get a say in how much mangement gets paid. There is NO comparing the two."
Foley: Yes in theory shareholders get a say like taxpayers don't ... but in practice is a totally different animal.
Perhaps government workers should take some unpaid 'Rae Days'. if it's good enough for Globe staff then it should work for the government folks.
The scariest part of articles like this that tell the truth is when all the public servant posters in this forum then begin trying to defend the un-defendable.
Dear Gov. Tea Bagger: Please move to Texas or Alberta.

"Having been a manager in a public service position I can attest to the fact that actually being able to responsibly 'manage' is made virtually impossible by the myriad of rules in place that constantly thwart best efforts and best practices. It is not impossible to shed incompetent employees but the process in place to do so is cumbersome and leads to a toxic work environment. And yet, with every new government the politicians pledge to manage more responsibly, a promise that is immediately downloaded onto the backs of the very managers whose hands they have tied!"
"I managed a union workplace for many years as well, although it was in the private sector. When I would read about excellence in culture based on real life examples, I would be envious. I had also managed the same type of business that was not union for many years previously and enjoyed the sense of 'partnership' between management and employees, like we both wanted the same things. Definition of parasite ... an organism that attaches itself to a host organism in a relationship where only one party benefits. This doesn't fully describe a public employee, of course, but in some ways it does. The entitlements that our dear leaders have bestowed when the parasites have threatened to destroy the host is unreal. The dear leaders themselves don't have the high ground because they too have gorged on the host (the tax payers). By all standards of business measurements, government business is far and away the largest business segment in the country. It has the largest budgets, the largest cash flows, and the largest employees base. It is an enormous, out of control, beast and it has us at its mercy."

"random dude: I was about to post similar advice to JOE_M, that Management as he refers to them is usually headed by a Deputy Minister who does the Minister/Government's bidding or is the first to be replaced and often is vulnerable to losing the job simply as a result of a change of government and perceptions that the Deputy favoured the previous party. More and more I am beginning to understand why the clueless in this country continue to support the Conservative Party whose policies least benefit the constituency that votes for them."
My point exactly Random Dude! Easy to make policy if you never have to climb down into the trenches and suffer the practical consequences.
yeh....8balland I suppose when the end of the fiscal yr was coming....you just gave back any excess.. as you didn't need it....or...did you blow it ..to make sure you could ask for at least the same... plus the 4% increase for inflation for next year ??? I've been there too... and I gave mine back.....cuz I didn't need it that year... and sometimes other yrs....Was there for 11 yrs... and gave some back six times....but..when I needed some... I got it...

"My observation is this: Public sector unions are inherently a bad idea. The nature of the relationships involved are not truly analogous to the private sector origins of collective bargaining, and so public sector unionization automatically tends toward the abusive. In the public sector: 1. Unlike the private sector, because there is no alternative service, the unions can exert extorionary power over stakeholders. 2. Unlike the private sector, there is no finite financial constraint -- virtually unlimited debt can be imposed on the pubic. 3. Unlike the private sector, management rarely has a direct incentive to hold the line. 4. The counterparties have a different nature. In private sector collective bargaining there are two private interests in competition. In public sector bargaining there is a private interest opposed to the public interest, which is a fundamentally pathological arrangement. Public sector wages and benefits should be pegged, by legislation, to a formula that sets it at the AVERAGE provided for similar work in the private sector. Job security should be a sufficient additonal perk to ensure these positions are readily filled. There is no reason on earth that the public should be required to keep its employees in plush comforts that the taxpayers themselves could never aspire to."
The problem with 'pegging' the wage level is that the Union will go out find examples of the highest wages in the private sector.
I do. Well said. All thanks to Lester B. Pearson who insisted in bringing in public service unions.
The reality is that the federal government holds all the cards - they just pass legislation to get their way - we will probably see something of this in today's budget.
"your observation is correct sir. As FDR once wrote (I know it's regarding the US, but it applies just as well in Canada):'The desire of Government employees for fair and adequate pay, reasonable hours of work, safe and suitable working conditions, development of opportunities for advancement, facilities for fair and impartial consideration and review of grievances, and other objectives of a proper employee relations policy, is basically no different from that of employees in private industry. Organization on their part to present their views on such matters is both natural and logical, but meticulous attention should be paid to the special relationships and obligations of public servants to the public itself and to the Government. All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service. It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management. The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations. The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters.'"
"Nice quote; thanks, Hairy. It's interesting to see some of these policy views of former presidents, like that one, or like Eisenhower talking about the military industrial complex. Does it seem like they were able to express more depth than the sort we get lately?"
'a formula that sets it at the AVERAGE provided for similar work in the private sector'MEDIAN makes more sense.
Median is a type of average.
.......Median is a type of averageOMG. Please read a dictionary.
'The problem with 'pegging' the wage level is that the Union will go out find examples of the highest wages in the private sector.'The other problem with 'pegging' the wage level is that politicians and media will find a finite number of lower examples in the private sector and call it 'average' to make the public service look more cushy and spoiled.

"Hey Rainman. I just enjoy watching you flop around like afish. 90% of math dictionaries define average as being the artimitic mean. IOW being the exact same thing. Granted , the remainder will define it as similiar to have you. however usually with the caveat NOT to do so in common prqctice because it's rarely , if ever, used that way . average, mean, median, norm mean something that represents a middle point. average is the quotient obtained by dividing the sum total of a set of figures by the number of figures . mean may be the simple average or it may represent value midway between two extremes . median applies to the value that represents the point at which there are as many instances above as there are below www. merriam-webster.com/dictionary/average"
"People think an average pegging is a silver bullet would be in for a surprise. There are a lot of professional jobs in the civil service that pay less than the private sector, but it's a trade off between stability and cash. Civil Service jobs pay decent money and you get their reasonably quickly, but gains after that are slow and incremental, you don't have the top end earning potential that the private sector does. Admin jobs would be affected, but there are less of those all the time."
"'sweeping changes to the way sick leave and disability are managed'Treasury Board has a principle that the cost of a total pay package in the public sector must equal the cost of the total pay package in the private sector for a similar job. That surely is done. If not it should be. Once that is done then the unions can decide how that total pay package is to be paid. Government has no role there. Then 'The entitlements accumulated by public-sector workers are like barnacles encrusted on the ship of state. It's going to take a lot of time and effort to get rid of them. But if we don't, the ship will sink ? and so will our grandchildren.'No definitely not right. The cost of the total pay package is the determinant. Not the cost of a barnacle."
"The problem is the pay package is not equivalent. The PBO recently stated the cost of the average federal public servant is $114,000/year.The average industrial wage in Canada about $46,000."
"What is the average wage in a lawyers office, joannie. Do you also suggest that their pay pacgake is not equivalent. Should they average down to the industrial average. Should the employes at the Mac milk store average up to the industrial average. Maybe next time you might think, THEN post"
f 'art..folks in the public sector are paid from tax payers....Most are wage earners... who send in thirty to fifty percent of their yearly income because they have no choice. Others are business owners.. small medium and large... These guys send in the same as the wage salary owners....but they send in another bunch from their businesses ..property ..etc...Public sector employees send in nothing... as they invested nothing but the cost of their clothes and cost of getting to and from work....whatever tax they pay....is paid by the tax payers....Public sector has been living in a bubble since the fifties

The Ottawa group is a privileged class.
"Actually, more will never retire at 55. Actually, more 60-year-old public servants are working till their 65+ because there aren't enough younger employees to fill their jobs. Only a very few are retiring at 55 anymore."
The retirement age for full pension in the federal public service was raised to 65 in last years budget.

"Thirty years of we are entitled to our entitlements in the public sector is a tough nut to crack, but with the private sector shrinking in Canada, it must be done. Name any government in world thats create wealth, except perhaps China for now, but how far into the future."
"Some government employees add value, but none create wealth. Bureaucrats get furious with this line, but therein lies the problem. Simple math dictates that 100% of public expenses are on the backs of private citizens who create wealth and we simply don't have enough of these private tax payers to support the government spending."
@phs: My thoughts exactly.
"phs, Every business uses government services at some point during the day, often continuously. Unless you are the sort that thinks public servants sit in the office filling in forms every day, you would realise that. Businesses need and use the infrastructure and assets provided by government, as do individual citizens. There are often individuals in a business who also provide no wealth - the comptroller, the receptionist, the network administrator, the HR staff or the corporate writer, but they all perform tasks essential to the operation of the company. Likewise, the government provides basic services and infrastructure on which we all depend at work and privately."
"john2012.....You miss the point phs is making. When we had 9 private sector workers contributing to the pot in which only one public sector employee draws his wages, that is sustainable. 9 people can afford the taxes required to support one public employee. But when you have 7 people drawing from that same pot in which those 9 are contributing, it is no longer sustainable. While those 9 people could afford one pay cheque, they NOT afford to pay 7 peolple. Canada has one of the highest taxpayer to public employee ratios in the world. We can NOT afford it."
"That was not phs' contention at all. He was stating 'ome government employees add value, but none create wealth.... 100% of public expenses are on the backs of private citizens who create wealth'Your argument suggests there has been a massive increase in the number of public sector workers producing these services which is also not correct."
"This is such a ridiculous comment. Governments do not create 'wealth,' as in dollars, but they certainly create value. Indeed, considering that government workers are responsible for maintaining the very essentials of our society ? without which the private sector cannot create any 'wealth' ? it's hard to see who could possibly create more value, whether economic or otherwise, than they do.But of course, if you just want to think like a myopic accountant, then sure, government workers are just a drain on the system."
"phs: That is a remarkably self-contradictory statement. By definition, if you add value, you create wealth in the exact amount of the value added. The issue of whether or not a particular worker creates wealth or not depends on the work they do, rather than the employer they do it for. As a few examples, you cannot consistently maintain that a private school teacher creates wealth but a public school teacher does not, or that scientific research funded by the private sector creates wealth but the same research funded by government does not, or that a privately paid security guard creates wealth but a publicly paid policeman does not, or that a privately paid defence lawyer creates wealth but a publicly paid prosecutor does not. A worker, any worker, creates wealth to the exact extent that the value of their output exceeds its cost."
true that SCALEWORKER....!!When a community's biggest employer is a hospital.. or a govt office... it's hard to get the message out. Atlantic Canada has bills to pay and families to feed.......Still......ALL public sector employees are financially better off than the bulk of the folks that send the taxes in to pay them. Lots don't have a pension plan.. health benifits... paid holidaysTheir work ethic goes like this.....you don't kill something....you don't eat.......if you are outta work... get some work....if your sick or disabled.....get to enjoy rice and macaroni
"What is not included in this are some basic facts. Teachers for instance are constantly being bombarded by germs. Those cute little kids are walking germ factories, who continually sneeze on you, wipe their noses with their hands then touch you. Many teachers have a huge amount of sick days when they first start because they are exposed to every bug going. For most, they get very strong immune systems but others don't. It is a hazard of the job. As are many jobs that deal literally nose to nose with the general public. You are often encouraged by management to take your germy self home when sick so you don't pass it on to the whole group. Many other jobs, people go to work sick and infect everyone else because they cannot afford to stay at home. Does this increase productivity, no. I have worked in the public service, private business and have been a business owner. People are just that, each group has the lazy ones, the hard working ones etc. The public servants are just the easiest ones to pick on"
The teachers at my kid's school made it very clear. The NEED those sick days. They have personal items and errands to run. They can't everything they need to do done of they work everyday. Take a day off without pay to do personal chores instead ? - not on your life.
"A big part of the problem is that our governments are trying to do too much , trying to keep everyone happy. Case in point is the EI systemThe conservatives could have simplified the system, taken out all the stupid rules, CUT the benefits, and done without the EI police. But no , the conservatives have to turn the system into a rule bound system requiring bureaucrats making judgemental decisions. The conservatives just don't get the small government idea, and in two years, they are going to pay for it."
"'Public-service perks are barnacles on the ship of state'____________________________________________I look forward to a follow-up article from Ms. Wente ? something like 'Senators are leeches on the taxpayers of Canada'While it's unacceptable that some civil servants abuse their sick leave allowances by as much as 18 days a year, many senators don't even show up to work for that number of days ? too busy campaigning for the party and racking up hundreds of thousands in travel expenses and claims for fictitious residences. As for government ministers, well their abuses are just too numerous to mention here, and would require several Wente columns. Over to you, Margaret............................................:-)"
"Fair enough. However the thing you leave out of the equation is that realistic remuneration for work is not all that earth shattering. Re-opening the Consitutional debate to eliminate the Senate, a bit more messy"
"Quite so. Except that we have barely 100 senators at the trough - and hundreds of thousands of not-quite-so-dedicated 'public servants'.Demanding more of 'the few' is a drop in the bucket, compared with modest reductions in the excessively-generous benefits enjoyed by many, many beneficiaries."
so ....if I'm guilty of wasting tax payers money.....it should be OK...cuz somebody else is wasting money too !!Give it up TONY.....the gig is up....the pendulum swung too far.....From the forties and fifties.. when govts only had a lot of clerics.. and a few managers.. etc..to NOW.....Just look around....civil servants got the highest standard of living on the planet ....being our public sector ....whom are living off our taxes..
banking sick days is intelectually dishonest....considering how they are utilized. Actions speak louder than words
"Civil service bashing is like shooting fish in a barrell, so easy. But does it reflect the reality of the work, no.People stay with these jobs because they provide security, benefits and a pension. The continuity provided by the civil service is a major component of effective government. Some feel it should respond more like private business but the rules do not allow this. Take municipalities. Money comes mostly from the provinces, feds and municipal taxes. With each program everyone has rules of how that money is spent etc. During the Harris years we joked that our work stations should literally be on wheels because our job and job location changed monthly. This cost the tax payer a huge amount of money in loss productivity alone. Was that the workers fault, no. Massive amounts of re-training dollars to learn new computer systems that actually didn't work very well, again the workers were told to do this. So when you as a tax payer came into the office you might wonder why that person didn't get up to help you. Sometimes it was they weren't trained on that system and didn't have pass codes to run it, but you saw a lazy person sitting thereWho are the barnacles on the ship of state to use Ms. Wente's analogy are often the politicians who make these new rules with little idea of how much it will cost to implement. Finally, it you really want to show you are serious about cost cutting perhaps the MP's who are making these rules should vote themselves a paycut, benefit cut and most importantly be made accountable for their own spending. What Pamela Wallen alone payed back would pay for many civil service benefits that were earned"
"I think you a good point that our governments are trying to do too much, and trying to be too clever. MP's leading by example; well yes, that is where it all should start."
"Well, the problem has become one of wage increases and entitlements. Many years ago in my 20's, I took a job in a federal department. In those days, federal workers were paid quite a bit less than private sector workers doing the same work. The accepted trade off was the pensions and benefit package. I recall very, very clearly in the late 80's when the unions negotiated a huge increase (based on some legal challenge) and our wages went up astronomically overnight. Now a civil servant earns the same if not better than a person in the private sector, and yet holds all the cards... secure pension, sick benefits, medical and dental plans, almost total job security, etc. Where is the justice in that?"
"In terms of salary, yes, entry level civil servents earn more than comparable entry level private sector employees. However, at the upper end (managers, etc.) an equivalent private sector worker will earn a lot more."
"Very simple solution. No pay for the first three days off. Now, is there anything else I can solve for you ?"
"You're incentivizing longer absenses. No thanks, Einstein."
"No he's not, he's putting a barrier up to filter out the easy scams. It's a good idea. Many short term plans (including EI if I'm not mistaken) have a waiting period before benefits kick in."
"That means passing on the flu, etc. If you're truly sick, STAY HOME so the rest of us don't get it and pass it on to others. However, banking sick days because you are not sick is just plain stupid."
"Saying we now have 'a two-tier system of workers: people on the public payroll, and everyone else' is just oversimplifying the complex nature of Canada's work force to prove a point. I would expect more intelligent writing from a Globe & Mail columnist"
I like how you make a sweeping statement aimed at discrediting but make no effort to offer an alternative hypothesis.
"Sburg: please explain how this dosn't exist, or have you worked to long in the public sector bubble?"
"Everyone in the private sector can not be lumped together in one pool. Managers in the private sector do not receive the same treatment, rights and benefits as the employees they supervise. Then there those in the boardrooms of corporations - you can't say winks and backslapping don't exist there. Actually, there is even some disparity in the public sector between those who are NOT part of a union (some administrators) and those who are. These administrators are entitled to more benefits than their unionized counterparts. This is what I meant by the complex nature of Canada's work force."
sburg.....It is kinda simple....when you are on the public dole.....y0u get a lot more pay... a lot more time off WITH PAY... a better benifit package.. and a much more juicy pension....Pretty simple....what have we missed out ???
"sburg... you are a public sector employee.....pampered and living in a bubble... You could never be successful in the private sector....you obviously have no idea what happens outside the bubble .I don't mean to demean you ....it is that you just don't understand how privileged you have been.....automatic raises....little or no accountablility....huge benifit package... both sides of retirement......and still you complain....when hundreds of thousands of people are out of work and had to get jobs with far less pay and benifits than before.........but not you , nor people like you .Not only do tax payers pay your salary and benifits... they pay your taxes too"

"Wente draws an implicit contrast between the ill and the conscientious and hard-working. A more insightful columnist might have looked at the various studies that have highlighted serious issues with stress, illness and badly outdated management styles in the federal civil service, right up to cabinet ministers who barely try to disguise their hostility towards the workers they oversee. But if pigs had wings they could fly....So the next time Wente shares one of her personal health crises with the Globe's readership I'll just attribute it to her 'feeling faint', to use her mockingly dismissive phrase. As for Graham's analysis: xhttp://search.dilbert.com/comic/40%25%20Sick"
"Not a very good piece, based on one real item of information -- public sector workers use sick days. The conclusion -- 'thirty years of winks and nods and passing the buck to the next generation of taxpayers have produced a two-tier system of workers: people on the public payroll, and everyone else' -- is absolutely unsupportable. If civil servants weight in at just over 100k on average, including pensions and all perks, they are firmly 'everyone else'. Beware of people who seek to drive wedges between regular joes. They aren't anybody's friends."
"Garbage. I was a federal civil servant and there are most certainly lazy slugs and incompetent workers who misuse and abuse the system. Wente is simply stating the facts, that any honest hard-working federal employee would certainly agree with."
Bravo Roger for telling it like it is.
roger was incompetent and lazY?
"Apparently disgruntled too. Seems he was sufficiently incompetent and lazy to get fired. Not surprised he's cranky, or that might always have been part of the 'package'.Anybody know any civil service line workers? They work hard, for not alot of money. If they have some security and a few pathetic 'perks', pay attention next time you are flying, playing golf at a private club, watching a hockey game at the arena, or dining at a decent city restaurant to who is occupying the good seats, and ordering the best of everything. They aren't paying for it: those are PERKS. Oldest game in the book is to distract the proles by setting them against one another."
"Typical union tactic. Any former worker that says 'Yeah, that's the way it is. They really do abuse the system' get's labeled as a 'disgruntled'. Oldest game in the book....when an insider exposes you, call him a liar and discredit him."
Wedge issue my a$$. Not agreeing is one thing. Having a complete inability to grasp that fact that some people are just sick and tired of having their paychequaes plundered is another
"Winston is still right about the fact it's a wedge issue. The criminal/business class perpetuate real fraud to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars on our economy. Many of these union-haters are worried about sick days, when their pockets are being picked and they don't even see it. Any government that was truly representative of ordinary Canadians isn't tolerated by the sycophants. Keep worshipping at the corporations feet Margaret."
"'Any union worth its dues will fight for its workers' right to exploit the system.'And any employer worth its profits will fight for its right to exploit its workers. One sweeping generalization deserves another. And all sweeping generalizations are wrong. There's a whole lot lost in this simplistic discussion of averages....1) How much does the Public Service average get skewed by long-service employees who get serious chronic illness (e.g., cancer)? Is it your view that we should just sack these layabouts -- bump them onto long-term disability and EI, for example, on the assumption that they'll never get better and come back to work? Gosh, that'll give them hope to hold onto. 2) How much does the private sector average get skewed by people in precarious employment situations, who are paid by the hour with limited to no benefits, and who essentially lose a day of pay if they're sick? How much does the private sector lose every year in productivity -- theirs, and the colleagues they infect -- from people who go to work with the flu or something like it?Where private sector employees have a similar level of entitlements (or even a moderate level), what is the usage rate? What do you get when you compare apples to apples, rather than comparing career public servants with part-time wait staff? I will admit freely: there have been weeks where I've been sick, toughed it out, gone to work and only taken the sick day or two towards the end of the week, once I felt I had delivered on necessary files. Guess I inadvertantly skewed Professor Graham's stats, there.'Governments have allowed the unions to sabotage effective administration, and the results are all around us.'Another sweeping generalization. Insert any other group there, and it would be hate speech that would get flagged and banned by your moderators. And it's an outright lie -- people have been disciplined, people have been removed. The biggest barrier to managing the Public Service like a business is structural: you can't switch your product lines in response to the market, because a Cabinet decision to start a program or initiative can only be overridden by another Cabinet decision to stop it.And 'banked leave' is not an actual liability -- it's a contingent liability, one that only comes to pass if every Public Servant falls ill simultaneously, to the maximum of their accumulated sick days. The odds of it ever happening are pretty much nonexistant. But it's much simpler to do the lazy journalism of using it as a scare number, isn't it."
"The issue of banked leave is when they are allowed to take it as either a payment or time off at retirement. In those cases it's not contingent, it's a certainty for whatever percentage of people typically reach retirement in-service."
'The issue of banked leave is when they are allowed to take it as either a payment or time off at retirement.'...Which isn't the case in the federal public service.
"banking sick time is an incentive to working when sick... a terrible idea, and not in the spirit of the benefit!"
"It is interesting that the article accomplishes the feat of criticizing public servants for NOT using up their sick leave AND using it. And, as noted, the banked sick leave disappears when an employee retires or leaves the federal public service."
"'banking sick time is an incentive to working when sick'I'll bite: how? Paying out banked sick time, sure, but just banking it? By contrast, not having sick time is a certain incentive to work when sick."
"banking sick timeYou're both barking up the wrong tree. The point is that excessive sick time entitlement leads to excessive sick time usage. It may be contingent, but the probability is high enough."
'And all sweeping generalizations are wrong.'Except that one of course!
"'Governments have allowed the unions to sabotage effective administration, and the results are all around us.'You're right about this being incorrect. The fault lies with the electorate.'We have met the enemy, and he is us.'"
"Hi Mark: although, to build on your point, it's a question as to what constitutes 'excessive' -- clearly, having none is too little. And as I suggest above, if you correct for the extreme end (people with chronic illnesses and a lot of service), the Public Service average may not be as excessive as people think....That, and I'm glad you caught my sweeping generalization point... it's kind of a zen koan. Remarkable that someone gave you a thumbs down for commenting on it...."
"'How much does the Public Service average get skewed by long-service employees who get serious chronic illness (e.g., cancer)? Is it your view that we should just sack these layabouts -- bump them onto long-term disability and EI, for example, on the assumption that they'll never get better and come back to work? Gosh, that'll give them hope to hold onto.'This is such a stupid argument. If a new employee who doesn't have banked sick days get cancer, should they be fired? Sick days are for short term illnesses. Serious illnesses should be handled by appropriate short or long term disability plans. It makes no sense to let everyone bank hundreds of sick days to cover a situation that will only affect a few."
"'Sick days are for short term illnesses. Serious illnesses should be handled by appropriate short or long term disability plans.'...I'll set aside your 'stupid argument' comment and set aside the fact that you're missing one of my points there (i.e., that the 18 days a year scare number being used in the original collumn doesn't reflect the typical usage)....Ok, so negotiate that. Put a cap on the total number bankable in the collective agreements. Either way, it doesn't reflect a real liability that will bust the fiscal framework (which is Wente's argument)....And BTW, statistically, it is the older workers with more years in who are more likely to get major chronic diseases -- sure, it's not unheard of for newer employees, but your policy should reflect the majority while having flexibility to accommodate the rarre cases...."
"Yes, the 18 days a year number is a 'scare' number that doesn't reflect typical usage. That makes a lot of sense. If 96% of federal employees took the private sector average of 9 sick days a year, that means the remaining 4% could take the *entire* year off to bring the average to 18 days a year. Does 4% of the federal government have chronic illnesses that require the whole year off?"
"Hi lcreilly: I don't know about a year, but I have heard of individual cases of six months. Even if that brings the typical use to 10-12 days (and I don't know this per se, just a possible guesstimate), it wouldn't be that wildly out of line of the average for those with benefits in the private sector....But then, Ms. Wente couldn't use it to power her recurrent 'Oooh! Unions!' rhetoric...."
Noticed your various response times throughout the day... wish I could get paid to comment on Globe stories instead of working
long term illness or injury is covered by Workers Comp....and EI....if the company has no group plan... This arguement about cancer... or some such long term situation....is not valid in the 'sick day's banking ' situation.....as the sick days are for shot term illness...'nuff said nowadays....'sick benifits' ...especially banking sick days.. are used with nothing whatsoever to do with 'sick days'....and it seems only the public sector seems to afford it.....NO MORE !!!
'It tells us that our workplaces are poisonous right now.'Can anybody remember the union bosses saying there are plenty of civil servants and morale is terrific ? ever?
since the seventies.....unions do not have a positive profile in the general public of Canada... USA as well. In the late twenties and thirties....unions were needed... child labour... sickness consideration... fair pay... pensions...safety in the workplace... THose battles have been won ...now...we pay union members $60K/yr to do what my 12 yr old paper girl has been doing for a year
"So, contract workers without EI and CPP is not a concern today? TFWs are not a concern today? The decline in pensions (and the resultant spike in government costs) is not a concern today? The lack of company-funded training and apprenticeships is not a concern today? All are issues that the unions are campaigning for on behalf of ALL Canadians. Your rhetoric is a couple of decades late, rider."
When it comes to contract work the public sector is probably the worst offender. It would appear the public sector unions haven't worked very hard to change this situation.
"You always like to say that the government and the public sector workers are in bed together which is why you claim it is criminal that PS workers are repersented by unions. Then you show a classic example of why we still need unions to deal with this type of issue. Of course, this SHOULD put to bed your claim about the cosy relationship but, of course, real facts are of no concern to you. Of course unions are campaigning against this but, as you see, the government holds the heavy hand. You might also consider the nature of much of the government contract jobs as well, and also consider whether this factor hasa part to play in the overall average compensation of PS employees. You, however, will always pick only the numbers that support your argument and ignore all others. Kinda like CFIB."
"I feel ambivalently about Wente's column. On one hand, I've seen plenty of slackers in government union shops. However, I also see a lot of dedicated workers who bring their best to the workplace every day. A lot of the absenteeism can certainly be ascribed to the slackers. However, there is a distinct lack of morale in many government offices because they are often seen as the easy pickings for their cash strapped employers, even though the same employers are willing to spend obscene amounts of money on their pet projects (F35 jet fighters, gas generating plant closures, wind energy subsidies, etc.). Also, the politicians themselves have by far the richest gold-plated pension plans in the world, far surpassing anything the public service has. Granted, the defined benefit pension plan is probably dead. The unfunded liabilities ensuing from such plans have effectively bankrupted a few municipalities in the US. Nonetheless, perhaps the politicians themselves could take a leadership role with regard to their own perks and maybe they can look at ways to reduce the waste that their little politcal pet projects represent."
"'Granted, the defined benefit pension plan is probably dead.'So what do you put into place to replace it, in particular when the workers in question make decisions every day that affect the market? If their retirement earnings are dependent on the market, how much will that skew their decisions?"
"@MMackinnon: the pension payout is dependent on investment performance ('the market') either way. If a DB plan doesn't earn enough in the market to pay its members, then they will either contribute more or reduce benefits. Ontario Teachers has been going "
One thing that doesn't seem to have been noted concerns the issue of stress. it might seem that a public servant should have a totally stress free job. The reality is quite different:- Public servants are often assigned responsibilities without the authority needed to do their jobs.- there is a host of rules that must be followed even under circumstances where they make no sense;- politicians will blame the PS for executing decisions ordered by the politicians;- the existence of often totally unrealistic expectations on the part of managers and politicians.
"Umm... no. Other than for teachers (whose decisions don't influence the market), public service defined benefit pension plans are dependent on the taxpayer."
"MqcKinnon, with the exception of the federal plan, there is no contributions to the pension plans and no top-up or guarantees other than employee payroll deductions. The federal exception is due to the $29 billion that the feds withdrew from the fund in 1999."
"MMackinnon,'teachers (whose decisions don't influence the market)'But they do, you just don't see it until 20 years later. How much of the problems in today's society are due to a lack of critical thinking skills? There's no reason not to start teaching these at the elementary school level."
"w_smith makes some good points. Many public service departments are meat grinders designed to wear down the best employees due to layers of policies, management, responsibilty with no authority, etc. The only thing really going for them are the benefits."
"People keep mentioning the stress that public sector workers are under. People in the private sector are under much more stress, because in addition to everything affecting public sector workers, private sector workers are also constantly judged on their performance, and they're laid off if their performance slips. Yet somehow we not only cope but thrive."
"Governments have not fixed the public sector pension deficits, they've merely increased funding contribution rates to cover the billions upon billions of dollars in funding shortfalls. Meanwhile we all pay for it through debt, delisted healthcare services, and infrastructure deficits."
Hi joannie: the federal government used to have a separate public sector pension fund (at least for accounting purposes) -- it scooped the multi-billion surplus in it to pay down the debt in the 1990s.
"And a couple of side responses: john, I was assuming this was talking about the federal public service, since that was the focus of the article. I thought that in law, at least, governments face the same contribution requirements as other employers. Mark, snappy point about teachers influencing market conditions... but they certainly don't do so in the same way as officials in Finance or Industry Canada (and not, typically, in a way that affects the teacher's pension fund). We've already had a DG in Finance canned for making undisclosed investments; if we take away the DB pensions, how many more will we have?"
"Makinnon, the funding for PS pension plans is not the same as for private sector plans. For one, public plans are not guaranteed by any level of government as private sector plans are in Ontario. Most Ontario plans specifically state that the only money that can be paid into the pension are payroll deduction. The federal plan is different as they made accommodations so they could take that 29 billion from the plan to pay down federal debt."
"At present....many a municpal, provincial.. and of course, Federal pension fund is financially unsustainable. CHeck it out. Due to greed of public sector unions.. and lack of 'lead in the pencil' of our elected officials.....Tax payers have been stick handled into paying public sector much more than they are worth....and cannot stop the leakage in the ship of state to correct this....unless re negotiation is on the table. Massive shifts to contracting out many services is one obvious option"
"It all starts with MP pensions. The conservatives on day 1 should have scrapped that plan, and then warned everyone that the deficit will be the NO. 1. priority."
"Putting MP's pensions on a defined contribution pension plan definitely needs to be done to ring them more in line with the private sector, similar to MPPs in Ontario who are already defined contribution. The same should be done for the rest of the public service as well."
"Workers in the private sector, who pay the largest chunk of public worker's salaries, just want a sense of fairness in terms of compensation and level playing field. It's not that hard to understand."
"But please don't paint everyone with the same brush. Government scientists often work weekends and almost never take sick days. They make less than colleagues at universities, and if they are stressed into sick leave it is probably because of dealing with red tape, apathy, and public misconceptions."
"Well, and if you excessively limit MP pensions, you excessively limit the classes from which MPs get drawn, so that only rich lawyers and other high-end professionals can afford to participate in politics....Sure, it's already biased that way, but why reinforce that?"
That would be what a conservative would do. That certainly isn't what we elected.
The gold plated MP pensions were reduced last year. Maybe not enough but reduced. Pay people a fair wage and make them responsible for their own pensions beyond CPP.
"Good idea, joannie. Pensions should be paid direct from payroll deductions (as in the public sector) so that they can fund their retirement rather than rely on unfunded government programs such as OAS and GIS. How many bilions are spent on those programs and how much have they ballooned in cost as DB plans have declined."
"manvillage....it does not....It is because a federal civil servant costs Canadian tax payers $150,000.00 a year... Provincial and municipal civil servants as much or more. GOt zip to do with MP'sMP's are out of the loop while they are serving.....most of them never made $140,000.00 a year anyway. You get out of your 'circle ' for eight... twelve years... you are out for good. othewise ...we'd have disgruntled truck drivers and bartenders run for office... as they need the money"
The kind of people we need to run for MP's are not folks who need the money !!!! OK ???IT starts at about $140K for a back bencher and goes up from there. In return ...an MP must deal with all kinds of complaints.. pleas and local situations that he/she may or may not be able to do anything about. I don't think we should lower the fee for service paid to MP's ....If you were taken from your profession or business... or area of influence.. for 4..8 or 12 years... you'd have no anchor. YOu'd have to start again... only older and with few contacts.. nor would you have a pulse on your industry ...or field of profession... or area of influence..... NO ...it is fair
Another reminder why I can't bear to pay for g&m content. So full of junk. I hardly ever visit this site anymore and when I do I'm always disappointed.
What will you do all day at your public sector job besides read G&M?
then don't ......I'd hate to see a guy's blood pressure go up.....take a walk....go swimming
"I find it very annoying that the present conservatives are NOT CONSERVATIVE. 26 Billion Deficit and counting... 11 cents of every budget dollar going to interest payments......With the way things are going, it might be easy pickings for the Liberals in two years."
It's a real shame that there isn't a single party out there that is willing to good stewards with our money. Let's hope one day.
'eager to buy labour peace by piling on entitlements'One of the main problems. Some public sector unions - like teachers - have also cleverly created a win-win situation where their members get the best of both worlds: job security of a monopoly plus the bargaining rights of the open market. It has to be one or the other. We get the useless rhetoric from both sides.'Public sector workers are all a bunch of over-indulged whiners' or the union favourite 'It's a race to the bottom' Useful phrases for ramping up the vitriol but neither is true. In Ontario - the Bob Rae's NDP once enjoyed public union support until they just couldn't afford it anymore so the unions went to McGuinty's Liberals. Now that the Libs can't afford to pay the unions are unhappy again. The point for any federal or provincial government is that pay and benefits for the public sector has to be based on what we the taxpayers can afford and not what people think they deserve. In return public employees enjoy a higher level of job and pension security. Banking unused sick days. If we can't afford it then stop doing it. or If it's a benefit workers deserve then put it into labour law and we'll all get it.
"Well, this is what happens when governments don't balance the books. They give the monies to their workers, and the rest of us get poor."
'Some public sector unions - like teachers - have also cleverly created a win-win situation where their members get the best of both worlds: job security of a monopoly plus the bargaining rights of the open market. It has to be one or the other.'Exactly!! Well put!!
"S.C./Toronto .....why do you think a teacher bargains in anything but an open market? Governments agree to terms of collective agreements , or impose them, as it suits them. Are you implying that a public sector worker has a different set of human rights from a private sector worker?"
Agreed--except if they keep the pensions defined contribution only and a 5-6% taxpayer contribution rate. Public Sector compensation should reflect private sector norms. 91% of private sector workers have no employer based pension plan.
fredgladHuman rights has nothing to do with it. It is a case of negotiating in a captive vs open market. And it doesn't apply evenly to all public sector workers either. Our military personnel don't have any bargaining rights or work to rule provisions. They have a set pay scale according to rank and seniority and a set pension and benefit plan. Don't like the pay and benefits? Then don't enlist. All public sector employment should be this way. Here is what we offer in pay and benefits. Take it or leave it.The teachers situation in Ontario was the fault of previous governments for abandoning that model. On the other hand - if the government wants to open up a competitive market with vouchers and charter schools so taxpayers can shop around for their child's education then by all means - negotiate and bargain your hearts out. Collective bargaining only works if both sides get to play. Witness the Toronto garbage strike/slowdown.The union exercised their right to withhold services. The city exercised its right to get somebody else. Hello private garbage collection - bye bye union. Both sides play - both sides take a risk - sometimes you win - sometimes you lose. That's bargaining.
"Joannie, whether the employer deducts 2% or 20% from my compensation to pay the employer contribution makes no difference to my compensation total!"
"fredgladIf a certified teacher with a B.Ed in Ontario wants to teach in another Province....go for it...or...if you really are that good....set yourself up teaching English as a second language...'for a fee'...or teaching many safety courses demanded by industry,,, doing a much better job than those old crippled truck drivers... who can barely read the pamphletsI took the same course twice... when I was working in the oilfields. One..from the 'old boy net'...who stumbled through the material... but got all of us to sign the forms....stating we had 'learned' what material that was supposed to be covered... a cuple yrs later... to re certify....a retired teacher presented the same subject.....Dangerous GOODs.. WHIMSIS.....I went out of there knowing exactly what officials would need.. and where those docuements could be confirmed... should they be lost in an accident... I knew who to call and what to say... Much better training. A lot of things could be done by the private sector... that are done by far too expensive govt employees... with no strings attached."
"Contribute as much as you want to your pension, I was speaking to taxpayer contributions to your pension and taxpayer liability for a defined benefit. 5-6% or no taxpayer liability. If the plans are as solid as you say, there's no problem with this."
"Read slowly, joannie,Whather the EMPLOYER takes 2% or 20% of my compenastion and pays it into my pension makes no difference to my total compensation.. Remember, joannie, there is a reason why pension contributions are calculated as a percentage OF compensation, not a percentage ON TOP OF compensation. Joannie reading comprehension fails again!"
"The CONS are ripping off the little guy again, they are doing this for a few bad apples that management have not dealt with, there doing this for us bull. So many people come to work sick and dont use there credits its shameful. They get others sick who come to work sick, who work at half messure, who go home to there elderly parents and get them dead quick. No problem giving away hundreds of billions of dollars to businesses of the middle classes money, raise our UIC and CPP, strip us of severence. Soon the rest of the private sector people will lose everything you have in benefits, pension etc for the sake of the country, we are this country and we will fight back."
You will fight back for your cushy taxpayer funded perks. You could care less for the private sector worker that has been thrown under the bus to keep you on your throne.
"'No problem giving away hundreds of billions of dollars 'No, there isn't that much to give away."
"Seriously, you could do well to take a refresher course in spelling -- not to mention logic."
recall.....maybe the wise and knowing civil service could take a little less... say....thirty to fifty percent of their vulgar pay and benifits......That way they would truely be in touch with their private sector counterparts....
"You could write a book on the problems of the civil service. Yes, you can criticize civil servants for using their 'sick' leave as a a day and a half of paid leave every month, but you also have to look at the other side of the coin -- is there a reason why they hate to go to work? At the end of the book, it is revealed that it is us who votes in the government that is supposed to manage the civil service."
Probably they are bored from not working hard enough and a culture of 'slow it down'. I know days go by fast when you are busy and they creep so slowly when you are truly not working and just watching the clock.
"That's true, Boogey, but the system in the government is that if you can build up positions on the org. chart below you, you can be re-classified at a higher level and get higher pay. It is an incentive in the PS to have too many people."
"Mr. Graham wants to stress that most public-sector workers are as conscientious and hard-working as he was. ---oh...so then contrary to the central thesis of the column, there really isn't a problem."
"Most isn't defined, but let's say it's 75%. 25% that are a problem is still a significant problem."
"Why the thumbs down for MarkTilley? I laughed at Pamphleteer's original comment (I took it as a witty comment on the article, which is the way he/she meant it I'm sure), but MarkTilley's certainly correct that even if 'most' public-sector and private-sector workers are hard-working, we still have a problem if the 'most' in the public sector is 75% and the 'most' in the private sector is 85% or 90% (numbers are given for comparison purposes only of course; I have no idea what the real numbers are)."
"Fair enough. There could be a significant minority of people who abuse the system. I doubt it though. In any case, why should be be encouraging a race to the bottom. So what if the private sector has sh!!!!! benefits? Why should we strive to ensure everywhere is a s!!! place to work? Government sets the example. It's to the great shame of private employers that they can't treat their employees just as well."
"The civil service is one of the last places where there are decent working conditions - and we should take that away? When people work for the gov't, they know they're giving up a lot, including any chance of fast promotions and eventual big money, and flexibility in the workplace. In exchange, they get security and good benefits. I'm not surprised that civil servants are taking a lot of sick days - there have been so many compressions that they're probably often over-loaded and over-stressed.Of course there are some abuses, and they should be addressed, but bringing everybody down to the level of non-unionized jobs is not the answer!"
"Either they bring everyone's salary up or the civil servants down, but we can't have this two class system which we now have. Sad that the only good jobs are in government, it is a testament to our failing economy and society."
I guess one person's meat is another person's poison... I can't think of any worse working conditions than having half the work force either dragging themselves into the office or booking off sick.. I cannot believe it would be very hard to shine in that type of environment... overstressed and overloaded... only in your mind dear...
"'The civil service is one of the last places where there are decent working conditions - and we should take that away?'==========First: Who is 'we'?Second: If those paying for it (taxpayers) don't have decent wages and conditions, why should they be expected to provide them for a small, lucky class?"
"I think the real issue is the economic value of work -- not 'we' or 'they' or 'unions' or 'non-union shops.' Typically 'the market' (and that means you, folks) dictates what is seen as valuable and what isn't."
"I have to laugh when I see unions proposing 'we shouldn't lower union pay, we should raise everyone else's pay up to union levels!'. Anyone that proposes that doesn't understand basic economics (just to spell it out on a general level: if everyone has a higher purchasing power, prices will rise commensurately, leaving everyone back the way they were beforehand). There is no difference, in the end, if we lower union wages or if we raise non-union wages. I certainly agree that we need to address the problem, though. Actually, the problem isn't the wages so much as it is the issue of seniority-based raises and promotions and the inability to fire unproductive or incompetent workers. Make pay based on performance and enable managers to get rid of bad workers and you'll have gone a huge way towards fixing the problem right there."
"Karen perpetuates the typical Unions myths: 1. Public Sector workers have given up a lot. HOW? When they make ON AVERAGE $114,000 in compensation, it doesn't sound like they've given up anything? 2. The public sector is some shining light that we should all aspire too. If that's the case, then why don't we nationalize every industry and then we can all go on the public salary? The difficulty there is that there will be no one to pay the bills when everyone is taking from the public till. 3. It's understandable that Public Sector workers take sick leave, because their jobs are so HARD! What ridiculous bunk. IF that were the case, then the Friday-Monday analysis wouldn't show up the trends that it did. They're simply lazy and - more importantly - allowed to get away with it.ALL of these perks need to stop. It is simply not fair that the single-mom waitress, busting her a$s for tips needs to be over-taxed so these protected public sector workers can book off outrageous amounts of sick time. It's unreasonable and it reduces our faith in the system. Taxes are fine when they go to pay for educational subsidies, reasonable levels of health care spending, or infrastructure. They're a problem, when they go to creating a sainted class of worker with many times the perks of the average worker who pays the toll. You Lefties wonder why Harper has the staying power that he does? Because people see the excesses and they want it stopped. C."
Sea to the Dea: Very well stated and the essence of the issue.
"'Taxes are fine when they go to pay for educational subsidies, reasonable levels of health care spending, or infrastructure. They're a problem, when they go to creating a sainted class of worker with many times the perks of the average worker who pays the toll'Yup. Very well put...."
Sea to the Dea..........You Lefties wonder why Harper has the staying power that he does? LOL!!! Staying power? Harper is in office because 39% of Canadians (kind of) like him and ....60% of Canadians would rather chew on broken glass than vote for Harper..
karen......you've been living in your bubble for so long....you have no appreciation....especially in your Central Canada region....for the tax payers who have to pay your salary and benifits. you never took a cut....but hundreds of thousands lost their jobs ...and took lesser paying jobs... with or without benifits.. to make mortgage or rent... You never took a nudgeBetter do some demographics....as you are in...what is called....A GOOD GIG.....but it is being paid by a bunch of folks who are selling their motorboats....mortorbikes....timeshare options.. cutting off some insurance... you....what did you give up..????? maybe a memo about future expenses on your account '''???Like England making policy on Canada....you are so sheltered and misinformed....you cannot make reccomendations on a situation you know nothing about.......respectfully
".'take off an average of 18 days a year because of sickness or disability ? more than twice as many days as people who work in the private sector'Well, that's just the point; Do we really want to compare anything to the private sector and the 'speedy' race to the bottom. Make no mistake, if left alone to the private sector we would be today in a recession/depression economic scenario. When employment statistics (wage and benefits) for the private sector in the past 25 years are closely examined, the private sector/corporations paid less in wages in 2011 then they did in 1990 with a 40% cut to (already meager) benefits. Now, how exactly is that going to work in our consumer spending economic model? Not very well, for references please see Canadian consumer (world) record debt. So, a race to the bottom Ms. Wente? Right to work=right to work for less? No thank you. Come back and see us when the private sector at least attempts to treat and pay it's employees fairly, giving Canadian workers exactly what we offer the private sector/the corporations; A stable economic environment."
"Unfortunately the private sector has to earn the money, pay taxes, costs and their employees and if they go in the red everyone loses. The government just raises taxes on the population to pay for the civil servants wage and benefits."
"No disputing the niceness of everyone having tier 1 salary and benefits but it can't start with government and then be left to the private sector to catch up. It has to be vice versa. Look at Greece, Spain, Portugal etc."
"cjpm......Look at Greece, Spain, Portugal etGreece = complete and prevalent tax evasion (for references please look up the US, the only difference being, in the US tax evasion is lega)l.Spain = banks crashed the economy, nothing to do with the public sector (fro references please look up; US, UK, Iceland and Ireland) Portugal = who knows.."
"Norberto's MomWell, there are many Norberto, but they will be (of course) discounted in a millisecond by 'some' because they are unionized. Put it this way, our big 5 banks are growing at the speed of light, profits at at record levels, YET, our banks have laid-off over 6000 people in the past 4 years, have drastically cut down on (VERY meager) benefits. Why? Because they/the big banks are not unionized and have successfully lobbied the government to make bank unionization almost impossible. ."
"Boogeyman3..........Unfortunately the private sector has to earn the money, pay taxes, Well, yes and no.The private sector corporations have been for well over 2 decades cutting the % of revenue paid-out to employees Meaning; less $$ paid-out, more profits, and that economic model is not sustainable. ."
Canada1 makes less sense then normal.
scaleworkerIs that even possible? .
"So Canada1 why haven't you been championing government legislation to provide equal pensions, benefits, healthcare and working conditions for private sector workers? I've been writing about this for years and all I've heard is 'entitled to my entitlements'.Government has no business using taxpayer dollars to provide better pensions, benefits, healthcare and working conditions for the private sector than what they are willing to provide or legislate for all. Now the chickens are coming home to roost. Looks good on you."
"joannie. wThe government has the right to negotiate a fair compensation package with it's employees. If you are of the opinion the private sector is not treating it's employees fairly in comparison to the government, well, start bugging the corporations to do soGood luck. ."
"To Canada1. The PIIGS problems all stem from excessive government debt brought on by excessive government spending. The biggest expense is government employee compensation, especially pensions."
"So, joannie, who has been calling for DB pension plans for all Canadians. Was it the CFIBOr was it the unions. CFIBs goal is to support their backers, the BIG business donors (despite their name) who make billions annually from your RRSP savings. Unions have been arguing against the decline in DB pension plans in the private sector and calling for their expansion."
"Three observations: 1. Ms Wente is a union member, and has plenty of benefits, in the same class as federal employees. 2. Ms. Wente is adopting use of 'entitlement' as a pejorative from U.S. media. 3. Our grandchildren will be lucky to find a job that pays a decent salary, thanks to the dog in the manger attitude that holds someone else has more and should be deprived of it."

"Doesn't cutting one government job almost instantly make it possible for the economy to generate 1.5 to 2 jobs? Gov. jobs drive up living costs now becauase mindless uncaring politicians failed to holld labour contracts to private sector levels and gleefully ripped off the taxpayer. 30-40 years ago, gov. jobs, as they are really only training jobs when compared to higher private sector levels, paid much less. We have about 30-45% too many gov. workers and every job and absurd benefits chop the head off of our economy and drive up living costs. Now, 20% of the population advances and 80% falls back. Revolutiionary change, ie competent ethical governmnet, is at hand."
"Some of the culture you describe is just human nature. And infected private sector businesses as well. Pulp and paper mills, the automotive industry are some examples where wages and work rules ran ahead of reality. In the private sector you eventually call the bankruptcy receiver. Note that the City of Detroit just called the bankruptcy receiver."
In both the case of Detroit and the industries you mentioned unions were a big part of their problem. Non union outfits have the nimbleness and flexibility to change.
"Look what happened with Yahoo... the chickens finally came home to roost when it was revealed that people who work at home are not very productive....I know a company who paid their salespeople a base of $75,000 and low and behold found they were not going out on any calls... go figure.."
"'I know a company who paid their salespeople a base of $75,000 and low and behold found they were not going out on any calls...'I call BS on that one."
"'I call BS on that one.'Me too. Salespeople have a pretty low base salary. But, if you meet or exceed your targets, then the big money rolls in. You don't meet your targets by not going on any calls."
so....what is our solution.......just say boys will be boys... Nonsence....freeze public sector wages and benifits until they match the private sector counterparts that pay their wages and taxes anyway
"'It doesn't necessarily require more money ...'Of course it does, and it would be HUGE. That's why nobody wants to touch it."
"In the 1960's Canada's health care system was rated at #4 in the world. Then governments, politicians and bureaucrats, central planners and self styled health care ' experts' and various interest groups have tried to improve the health care system, to make it fairer... achieving the exact opposite to what they had anticipated, dragging our one proud health care system into a down spiral. Full of misplaced confidence ' They' are still at it...god help us all."
"This is a death knell for the safety net of public health care in Canada. It would create a cold, uncertain, frightening country for our children to survive in. They might just as well be Americans. Citizens together must actively protest any loss of government interest in maintaining and improving our national health care system. And while we are at it we should demand to know if scientific research is actively seeking cures for the chronic diseases that plague our lives. Thanks to the Globe for this heads-up on government neglect of health care for Canadians,"
It is natural to want more than we can afford. Health care is the jurisdiction of the provinces. Federal government is wise to not interfere. As the provinces approach insolvency there will be an opportunity to improve the focus on needed change in health care.
"The Feds give the money to the provinces, the provinces dispose... each province is responsible for how it spends and wastes the money given to it...the provinces scream blue murder when the federal government attempts to tell them what to do with the money given. No province has ever respected the Canada Health Act in its entirety and no Federal government has ever bern able to strong arm the provinces to do so.Unhappy about what you re getting from your health care system? Look to your provincial health care political/ bureaucratic leaders... in Ontario the money has been wasted as the government squandered the tax payers' hard earned monies on EHealth, ORNGE (and the outrageous ' bonuses' paid out) and the LHIN money pits. It amuses to see ideologues such as Picard pointing to Ottawa as the provincial health care systems stumble rather than at the provincial capitals. Picard's dogmatic belief in centralization, in statism, collectivism also amuses... pharmcare would be yet one more state run money pit who could not provide an aspirin effectively and efficiency... we already have shortages in various medications because of government interference as they drive big, bad , nasty pharma with their research facilities out of the country. Behind every shortage around the world, apart from natural disasters, one will find a government hob nailed boots... want shortages in Canada?...let the government to take over the particular field."
"Nothing looks good for Christy Clark.....unfortunately, as is typical with BC Voters... they throw out the baby with the bathwater. The NDP will absolutely sweep to power....and with 4 years.. certainly 8, they will decimate our Province, one way or the other, and BC voters will swing back away from them. Take a lesson from Albertans BC.....toss the leader... NOT the party."
"This inane leader 'earned' these low numbers. Unfortunately, typical of BC voters....we threw the baby (party ) out with the bathwater........BC voters have yet to learn from the last 35 years... that it is better to oust the leader not replace the party.....we should learn from Albertans..... but we never do."
"nah, replace this party."
Michael T. SharpNegative and bitter. It's all you need to know.
"The lying BC Liberals have not scrapped the HST. Remember the HST? Gordon Campbell promised no new taxes during the last election, and when he was re-elected voila we suddenly had a new tax the HST. Campbell lied his way to the top of the Liberal heap. Many BC'ers have given up caring about politics because politicians compete to tell the best lie and commit the greatest fraud.( the NDP do this equally as well if not better )Anyhow unless the BC Liberals are psychopaths they should resign their fate."
"Except that is a computer-only poll, and I know people who are laughing as they are asked weekly to enter the polls. They lie like mad. There are no 'right answers' Everyone is gaming the poor sods at Ipsos-Reid.Now of course the games come out as outliers, but the results of many items are not as the voters in the poll felt. Increasing the poll to 2000 people would not make it more accurate. Woof said the dog to the pollster."
"'Everyone is gaming the poor souls...' When you post ,beware the use of sweeping generalities. From your comment, one must assume you have omniscient powers, peering over people's shoulders as they hunker down at their computers. You must also be clairvoyant, knowing who these anonymous people are!!"
Enjoy your carbon taxes wasted on corrupt gavernment schemes. Morons
"Exactly which 'corrupt government schemes' has the carbon tax been wasted on? I'm no fan of the BC Liberals, but the (revenue-neutral) carbon tax is one good thing the Campbell government brought in. It seems to be spurring a decrease in fossil-fuel consumption. The NDP will keep the tax, but may direct some of the revenue to green projects. So, yes, I am enjoying the carbon tax."
Like spelling and punctuation?
Good analysis: rather than'...More worrying still is the fact that one third of those who voted for the Liberals four years...' use '...More worrying still for the Liberals is the fact that one third of those who voted for them four years ago...' Then it doesn't sound like we're all worried about the immanent demise of the B.C. Liberals. I know many of us are quite enjoying it.
"Things could get a bit better for Christy Clark & her team once she visits your town with millions of dollars. Since leaving the legislature Christy is back campaigning across BC with cheques & plenty of photo-ops. When she returns to Victoria, it will be up to the Finance minister to figure out how taxpayers will fund Christy's election shopping spree. According to the latest information of the BC Liberals who keep telling us they can manage our tax dollars better than anyone: ' On average the BC Liberal government have sunk BC taxpayers into debt at a rate of $495,000 every 43 minutes. Under the NDP during the 90's it was $140,000 every 43minutes. Have you had enough yet ?"
Her numbers are surprisingly high.. 28% ??
Right. Should be 0%.
"its was a typo, should have read: 2.8%"
Of course the numbers don't look good for Christy Clark. She tells lies about her level of involvement in scandal after scandal. The only thing she has going for her is a woefully complicit Vancouver Sun and A corrupt federal police force (RCMP) who won't investigate very clear evidence of her and her government's involvement in bid rigging. See the evidence for yourself: alexgtsakumis. com/2013/03/19/exclusive-breaking-news-pat-bell-accused-of-bid-rigging-wood-design-center-shirley-bond-demanding-government-funding-and-christy-clark-supporting-both-actions-dan-mclaren-and-brian-fehr-spe/
Tsakumis is doing the heavy lifting of investigative journalism that the corporate media is unwilling to do.
"First, this incompetent, back door, irresponsible, unelected BC Liberal Premier has to go regardless of whatever or whomever comes next. BC has more than enough Conservatism coming out of Alberta and Ottawa without adding anymore jag offs into the mix. This leaves the Green Party who are too limited in numbers and support to form a government which leaves Dix and the NDP. I'm definitely no fan of Dix as he comes with some past improprieties of his own and that fact does give me pause for concern. So now that I have considered the dismal list of choices, I'm stuck holding my nose and wishing there were more options but it looks as though Dix is the lesser of all the evils, Green Party aside. Dix had better have some hard line ways of controlling spending with a focus on Education, healthcare and law enforcement as those three areas do require a basic level of common sense. The BC Rail inquiry has to be a full public inquiry and not one of those idiotic, by invitation only, scenarios that the Conservatives dream up."
"Regarding past improprieties (your'e not Jane Austen by any chance?), are you referring to Mr Dix allegedly being caught without a train ticket? I hardly think a man of the stature of Mr. Dix would deliberately try to avoid a measly train fare."
"The Fiberals have to go all they have done is lied all the way along and missrepresnted things. Broken international labour laws, changed FOI rules so that what was once free costs 63K. There is not one of them that can tell the truth they are tottaly anti democratic in every way.. like they like to stack the deck at public info sessionmand radio call in shows.. lame so lame. Persons like to say the NDP are just as bad because of this reason and that however I have a list as long as both my arms about what the fiberals have done and I can only recall three things the NDP appairently did wrong so its not difficult to pick who tells the truth more often. I Can hardly wait to have a huge celibration party when there finished and squashed like bugs!"
Frankly I'm surprised the party didn't dump her.
"Priemier Clark has proven herself to be the most venal of politicians - a grip-n-greet photo op maven of opportunity who has given little thought to anything other than empty promises. Choosing political opportunism over good governance at every opportunity, her actions are not lost on an increasingly irritated electorate. When compared to the thoughtful, composed and experienced Adrian Dix, Ms Clark comes off as a poor second choice even for die hard free-enterprisers like myself. If Mr. Dix can contain the entitlement expectations of his socialist base, he and his party appear well suited to governing. The release of his detailed policy platform once the campaign begins will tell the tale."
The NDP are saying one practical step at a time .
"Thank God. It will be good for the liberals to go out to the wilderness for a while. Their economic stewardship has been a disaster. They had no sense as to how to respond to a recession, and we're worse for it."
"Michael T still trying to project the future although Premier Redford wasn't too good at projecting as she tanked on her revenue projections. Fact is, nobody has a crystal ball and any idiot that tries to suggest they know what the economy will do is totally naive. As for waiting, wait is almost over as the economy has flat lined at the federal level as Canada's economic growth is less than that of the US even with their idiotic Economic Stupidity Plan."
@ M.Sharp... You dare to invoke God's name while discussing these corrupt crooked Lieberals?
The Christy Clark Liberals have become more corrupt and inept than the Gordon Campbell Liberals . It has become so obvious that the Liberals are so entrenched in corruption the only way out is to completely clean the slate .
"you mean 'as corrupt as' the Campbell government. gordo wrote the book on how not to serve the people, and instead stuff his(and his follower's) pockets"
"The budget was the eighth balanced budget in a row presented by the Liberal government. It contained minor tax cuts for both businesses and individuals over a five-year period. These cuts, however, were mostly scheduled to begin in the latter years of the five-year period, which meant that the majority of them were unlikely to occur before the next election was held. The personal income tax cut raises the basic personal exemption to $10,000 from its former level of just over $8,000 over the five-year period. This was projected to result in an average tax savings of $16 for each Canadian in 2006, with the final total reaching $192 at the end of the five-year period. The basic personal exemption is indexed to inflation, so it would likely have risen to roughly $9,000 over the five-year period without the changes. The budget also contained $12.7 billion for the Department of National Defence over the following five years. However, not all of this money was new funding and, as with most of the budget, it was back-loaded. The total new funding for 2006 was to be $500 million....THE GOOD OLD DAYS!!! I MISS THEM... DON'T YOU?"
"I get sick and tired of hearing the elderly are draining the health care system. The elderly have paid into this system all their lives and at the time of their lives when they need it, they are treated as parasites on the system. An immigrant or refugee can land here and immediately get health care without having paid one cent into it. Then under family reunification can bring in their elderly relatives and they get free health care w/o having paid once cent into the system. Thankfully this government is cleaning some of that up. Several years ago a recent immigrant stated to myself and others that his mother living in another country needed surgery so she was going to come here as an immigrant and when she had her surgery would go home again. I wonder how much of that went on? Another problem with our health care is there doesn't seem to be any oversite mechanism of the system. The hospital in my city is woefully inadequate for the population it serves. Yet I'm constantly reading in our newspaper of another high priced direcor of this or that department, while nurses can't get hired on a full time basis. Our hospitals are so lacking in cleanliness standards, that we are getting outbreaks of infections quite frequently, resulting often in patients being readmitted after being sent home from surgery. This is very inefficient. There are a lot scary stories out there of lack of cleanliness standards. At one time you could go into a hospital and there were people cleaning all the time and you felt safe. Not now. So before we blame the elderly for the high cost of health care, let's get some standards in place, and an audit process to ensure it is being followed."
"Health care. THE problem is that, as some wise man said, one level of government is collecting the taxes and other levels are spending it. There is no responsibility. No matter how much you favour health care in government hands, the financing and running must be in the same hands. There Mr. Simpson is the cause of the large, huge cost of health care. The elderly. Placing responsibility for a huge cost on the elderly is irresponsible. The elderly pay taxes. How does taxes from the elderly compare with costs of the elderly? Further, it was government not the elderly that decided to pay OAS to everyone. Many, maybe most, do not require OAS. The poor, the poor of all ages require help. Now the feds are in to job training, another provincial responsibility. So it is government interfering in our lives that is responsible for the deficit. Not Canadians using health care; not the elderly."
"If you look at job ads where employers are looking for workers, then one thing you always find there is that very few employers are willing to hire and train inexperienced workers, who have the right kind of education. Virtually all employers are looking only for experienced workers, even if this means going abroad and finding workers there to bring to Canada. Because it doesn't make sense for Canadian companies to invest anything in their workers. They want ready-made workers who don't require any investment at all. A company can spend a lot of money, effort, and time to train an inexperienced worker. And once they pay this cost, then their competitor can easily offer a little bit higher salary to the trained worker, and he will go to work for the competitor. It's a competitive disadvantage for companies to hire inexperienced workers and train them. Because a company can end up subsidizing its competitor this way and lose profits as a result. The reason why Germany and the Scandinavian countries are so good at getting their employers to hire and train inexperienced workers is that they either pay subsidies to employers to justify this cost for employers, or they lower worker mobility, where companies don't need to be afraid of losing their trained workers to their competitors. Canada needs to solve this problem that makes Canadian employers afraid to hire and train inexperienced workers. Because Canadian schools can never provide the kind of work experience that Canadian employers are looking for. Employers will keep hiring experienced foreign workers from abroad, no matter how many inexperienced Canadian graduates Canadian schools put out."
Never heard of apprentices being indentured ? Problem of skilled workers moving to competitors solved.
"Employees don't leave simply for 'a little higher salary'. It's either for a substantially higher salary, familial reasons or their current employer is an a**hole."
"Is the jobs training program the first admission by Harper that devolving powers to the provinces or relying on a strict constitutional interpretation of jurisdiction is not always workable in Canada. Is it an unacknowledged admission that there is a reason federal/ provincial relations have evolved in the way they have for a reason? The switch involving training is 1 of 2 in this budget runs contrary to Steven Harpers philosophy of federal provincial jurisdiction sharing. The other being securities regulation. I also find it interesting that a number of articles written since the budget, including this one acknowledge that Canadian businesses are in large part to blame for the alleged problem of a skills shortage in Canada. The German apprenticeship approach is in high contrast to Canadian businesses that not only don't engage in apprenticeship but also increasingly look for years of experience in junior positions , among other wounds that are self inflicted. Perhaps the government should engage in some research and training to help businesses better use the skills that are available and to recognize the value of investment in employees."
"Come on Homer, you can do better than that. How about another diatribe about how the Conservatives missed another chance to impose a carbon tax."
"When will dinosaur thinking finally give way to evolution? US non-profits are already rewriting treatment with better outcomes and much lower costs by using computers - duh! Why can't I skype my doc for simple appointments? why can't seniors? I finally managed to get an appointment by email last week - a small; step for people, but a giant step for medicarisaurus. I want my medical records and OHIP billings online so I can stop falling through the cracks and do modern research to get better care. And when will they stop inflating costs and then pretending they are real? Let's give up the ghost of enormous medical costs for seniors, which only applies when they are improperly treated in hospitals rather than with homecare and proper retirement facilities built for people rather than as doctors' tax shelters."
What device does skype have for me to carry out a rectal exam and check your prostate and any local masses?
Eventually we are going to have an adult conversation about health care. 100% public funded is becoming a no longer viable solution. A more 50/50 split is going to have to occur. If 25-30% of the population is an age bracket that is no longer paying taxes. Who shaped this country from work and taxes before. During a time when they brought in health care there where 7-8 people paying taxes for every govt employee. Today it is down to 3. Which means there is way more tax money going to pay salaries than going to needed funded social networks.
"I have news for you, a lot more of our medical care is private than you and most people realize. One biggy of rapidly increasing importance is drugs which are private outside of Quebec (which is hybrid)."
"Every one of our services that are in the private sector works. Those in the public sector don't. Why should health care be any different? So government in taking over health care ensured it would not work as well, and most important it split responsibility. The feds raise the money, the provinces spend it. No one is responsible. And we old guys pay taxes. I would suggest there is more coming in from us than going out. Guess I better start going to the doctor, and even more costly emergency, more often."
If it is not publicly funded through your taxes you pay more for the private care. In the end you pay more. They gotta make that profit somewhere. \Pay $4k a year to the government now or pay $3k to the govt and $3k to the private sector tomorrow.
".They might have added that the deficits of today are in part the result of tax cuts of which the Conservatives are very proud and from which they benefit politically. Well, the truth hurts . We are where we are economically due to two basic factors; 1) the recession 2) the politically motivated and economically brain-dead GST cut and the many other redundant tax deductions brought in by the Harper conservatives. So/thus, in essence, the Harper conservatives crashed the Canadian governments fiscal integrity and are at this time telling us how well they are doing fixing a problem which they caused and are responsible for in the first place. You can't make up 'stuff' like this..................."
So far Harpers GST cut has increased the debt by 80 to 100 billion.
"It takes cutting 20 welfare recipients to create a federal worker with nine stat holidays, 18 sick days, three floaters and two discretionary days, and let's not forget generous holidays of 4-6 weeks, or, in other words, a part-time federal worker, typically doing little but lots of mileage activity wherever possible. But seriously, cutting federal waste and using these funds to provide more tax-exempt income for low-income Canadians would bolster the economy and create more jobs for everyone, creating a spiral of growth."
"Live by the loop hole, die by the loop hole. Corp loopholes, like wormholes: new ones open as fast as old ones get plugged. Do not worry about the elderly gettin' too much money. That picayune five hundred a month will all get spent back into the system, keeping young people working. It will be needed by most for maybe fifteen years before they check out. Stashed elderly money, life insurance, hard assets go to their kids or survivors. Well -off elderly pay taxes too including sales taxes. Quit bleatin' about their CPP and other pensions. They paid in for a lifetime of work; others- including the corp pension fund managers- will get income from the pensions while they live. Some elderly cash will go to charity. Elderly health care keeps nurses, doctors, hospital CEOs, pharma, in income. College and University post-secondary programs in nursing , gerontology, other health care are loaded up.It is known that jobs will be here. Helping financiallywith education of Canadians is almost the only thing the national and provincial governments are doing right. Elderly money, time-limited ,will circulate, not stay in shoeboxes. That paltry OAS and supplements get spent or spread around. The real looming costs, responsible alone for this government's and all the provinces' deficits: ongoing, NOT spread around , Corp tax cuts, sequestered somewhere not even in Canada, depriving Canada of $ to spread around., Almost all Harper/Flaherty 's doing..."
You missed tax benefits. Every financial instrument including pension plans and RRSPs and 27 more according to Lower Tax Guide transfers money from all taxpayers to the people who use these vehicles. They favour the not poorer. 'charities' including political parties......Do Canadians require a bribe to give to someone?
"The political class have finally recognized the demographic age tsunami... Canada is ageing... no doubt about it...the work force supporting the retiring and aged is shrinking in a relative sense... one can expect 1:3 aged to develop dementia....health care costs will surge. In the early 90's the political class was blind to the unfolding demographic age wave... waving the Barer Stoddard report which declared that Canada had too many doctors they slashed medical school placements, specialist training positions and drove 11,000 Canadian trained doctors out of the country including many who trained doctors. Now the same blundering political class is in a state of panic... observe how the various provincial governments who are primarily responsible for their health care systems are thrashing about... expect them to throw together further unworkable and expensive plans and policies which will compound problems rather than aleviate them."
I don't think they missed it entirely. Reform in recognition of the fact of aging is what put CPP on a sustainable track.
Every time I hear about health care and the elderly I think about a video I saw that was recorded in Alabama. There was a meeting on 'Obamacare' and it must have been organized by Sarah Palin or her ilk. An elderly woman came to the front and talked about her husband who was dying at home without support. She was crying and she was greeted with jeers. This is what we are coming to in this country... no compassion for the 'failures' in the capitalistic race. Alabama... Arizona...Alberta...let's get on with it....
You will die at home without support too in Ontario. You won't be getting much home care certainly not enough hours for a senior woman to look after her husband.
Give the poorer money so they can look after themselves. Not just for health care - all their needs.
"Yes, because blank cheques are always the answer..."
You must be healthy....
"I tell ya, if they hadn't been so aggressive in taxing cigarettes, there would be a lot less elderly screwing up the budget right now..."
I can only hope this is sarcasm.
And adding MPs at a huge cost that we DO NOT need. And I need new people but a foreign worker is already trained and ready to go. And cheaper too. A trainee here is at least two years away from being able to go on his own at a cost of 50k per year. So they give me 10k and want me to put in 90k? Plus benefits. This will not help train skilled labor. Its a joke.
"'Put another way, they have been forced to cut spending by their own tax cuts, and by the many tax expenditures they have inserted into the tax system. Indeed, it was ironic Thursday to see the big deal the government was making about closing 'loopholes,' some of which are tax 'expenditures,' having injected so many others into the system.'Is there any surprise here? This was Mr. Harper's plan from day one."
"Man, I just attended a meeting yesterday that infomred me that I could put a bunch of cash into an exempt UL life policy and use a colateral loan at old age and pay little or no tax. I was skeptical but it sure looked good on paper. I'm actually happy that they put the hammer down of these ahady looking deals. We need more clarity as consumers of these complex financial 'concepts'."
"I don't think Canadians really appreciate the grand-scale effects of the aging population. From a public health perspective, we see people living longer but with numerous chronic health issues. Generally speaking, as Canadians age, they use more health care resources and there is a dearth of funding in preventative health care to reduce this effect. From an economic perspective, we see more and more consumers of health care resources and proportionally fewer people paying taxes to fund them. With our skewed demographics, the consumers will soon out-pace the contributors."
"You can't prevent health care usage, a type II diabetic doesn't live to 95 spending many years in LTC or ever get dementia. The healthy poor seniors are a huge burden as well, OAS, GIS and a senior's apartment in my town costs well over 25K each, then you move to LTC you cost another 60K each."
"Place health care in the private sector, give the poorer money to fund all their needs, not just health care. I suspect it would cost less. If it doesn' then there are literally thousands of tax breaks which can, in fact should be eliminated."
"How does private health care cost less? By definition, something privately run needs to turn a profit. That in itself adds cost. Unless you expect wages to fall."
"Art, I suppose the US would be a good model for you where the public gets a lot less coverage for a far higher price. As jafo states, the profits have to come from somewhere!"
We worked and paid taxes all these years. The Feds took our tax money and saidthat when we get elderly one of our rewards would be a affordable health care system. We have never abused the system but we are suddenly told that we are costing a lot of money and the government will have to cut back our benefits. Why did the Feds not cutback on the inefficencies of the immigration system that has created a huge burden on health care. What about eliminating the huge cost of Bilingualism that costs the Canadian taxpayers 40 cents of every dollar. Do not get old as there will be no rewards from these guys.
"Are you saying 40% of our tax dollars go towards funding bilingualism? You'll have to provide a source for that claim. Immigration was a main driving force behind the economic growth of our country. Without that, our economy could never have built the health care infrastructure we now enjoy. It might be wise to look at where the health care funding goes. For example, the amount of non-essential personnel (my opinion) in some areas of health care is absolutely absurd. I work in the chronically under-funded community support sector, so I know the deal."
"Knowing that these big costs were coming, why did you leave a pile of debt that now inhibits new spending (aka investment)on health care and old age benefits? I'll tell you why, because in your pursuit of social justice, you forgot that it had to be paid for from current taxes and not borrowed. I bet you felt pretty progressive at the time."
"None of you are going to like this at first. Read to the end. Here are two ways to reduce the cost of health care: Second if you don't like private health care, then make either the feds or the provinces responsible for health care. One collecting taxes and the other spending the money is a recipe for irresponsibility. First let the private sector run health care. Just look around, have you had any trouble with any of the systems run in the private sector? Supplementary health care insurance, house, car insurance, food supplies and on and on. Then there is social housing and health care in the public sector. Should government cover the cost of anything, including health care for anybody that can afford it themselves? Give the poorer money so they can live like us, accessing the private sector for all our needs. 'Immigration was a main driving force behind the economic growth of our country'. The media said that was we veterans coming back were responsible. I believe it was the quiet propaganda program that got women to join the work force."
Private sector health care costs a LOT more and provides a lot less. Is that really a model that you want to explore?
Only if you rule without healthy care. I cause health---Hart Health.
"The usual sort of drivel one expects from Gary Mason. Trying to spin it as a presentation problem. What a joke. The project fails on the facts, not because they were inadequate in spinning it properly to the rubes they take us to be. Advertising by Enbridge is nothing more than expensive shameless self promotion. Anything they have to say is hardly trustworthy given they have their eye on making billions of dollars. Self interest of that magnitude has a way of skewing one's perception of reality. The facts are what matter. Think Exxon Valdez. Think human error. Think of Enbridge's own admission that it would not be possible to buy enough insurance to cover a supertanker oil spill on our coast. Think of Harper disemboweling statutory environmental protections. Think of the consequences of freeing up all that carbon. (Perhaps Gary Mason believes climate change has just not been explained properly by the harvesters of coal and oil?) Maybe some people will make up their minds on this issue based on whatever Enbridge tells them, but I expect most British Columbians are thinking for themselves instead and have concluded Northern Gateway is a non starter."
When you start off by labeling anyone who has legitimate concerns 'radicals' you've basically shot yourself in the foot. If the Conservatives are stupid enough to push this disaster through then they're finished in this province and they can kiss their majority goodbye.
"If Harper's gang knows Northern Gateway's already de facto dead, Enbridge surely knows it too. Yet both continue to promote the project regardless. Perhaps Mason's correct in suggesting Harper's Cons, while pretending to be paving the way for Norther Gateway, are instead focused on preparing the way for different, future pipelines, & have secretly given up on Northern Gateway. Presumably the continued pro-Northern Gateway pose is also a way for Cons to pander to their Alberta & Big Oil base. Enbridge too is likely going through the motions of promoting an impossible project in order to play to its 'base', its shareholders. If Enbridge formally announced it was now abandoning Northern Gateway, shareholders might view it as a sign of weakness from co. management. Such an announcement could also cause the stock price to plummet. It would be interesting to see insider stock sales stats by co. execs to see if they're quietly dumping personal stock shares in anticipation of Northern Gateway's demise, even as they still publicly promote the project that's deader than a door nail."
I hope Gary Mason has read a few of the previous comments. Might learn something...
"...and while we are on the topic of Christy Clark BC Liberal scams ( and there must be 100's by now ) the BC Liberals have just announced that the scandal-plagued Wood Design Center in Prince George that 2 businessmen have implicated Pat Bell and Shirley Bond in attempts to practice influence peddling, is going to be built by PCL Construction. The big announcement was of course 'helmed' by Shirley Bond and Pat Bell. Surely you all must have heard of this company PCL:- there's the $130,000+ in donations to the BC Liberals...- there's the fact that a number of PCL's winning bids have gone magnificently OVER-budget (the Vancouver Convention center and BC Place Stadium roof, just to name two ) and...- thee's the matter that PCL is listed as a defendant in the BC Place roof cables lawsuit. Another nice choice for contract awarding by the corrupt BC Liberals !Just the corrupt BC Liberals Paying Back all their cronies before they are booted out of office this May... can't come too soon!"
"On the most important issues of our time--the environment and climate change--our government has no credibility, either globally or at home. The people who voted for them have a lot to answer for."
"The Vancouver Province has learned this week that once again, members of Christy Clark's premier's office used BC government resources and the services of BC government staff, on taxpayer paid government time, to form an Attack Team focused this time on the B.C. Conservative Party and it's leader John Cummins !The BC Tory Attack Team members included a research officer with the BC Liberal government caucus, ministerial assistants, staff in Christy Clark's Premier's Office and a director of strategic planning for Government Communications. The team was under the direction of Dimitri Pantazopoulos, a principal secretary to Clark, who now is on contract with the B.C. Liberal Party, and the attack team was chaired by Sam Oliphant, a research officer with the BC Liberal caucus. This makes 3 separate 'Teams' of BC Liberal party members working with members of BC Liberal government staff, all working on our taxpayer paid time at the legislature to improve the odds of the BC Liberal Party and Christy Clark in the coming election !Once again this is another highly unethical operation by the BC Liberal government working in cooperation with BC Liberal Party staff, and using taxpayer paid resources and staff to give the BC Liberals an unfair advantage in the coming May election.

"If a wasn't convinced the federal government is absolutely wrong on this pipeline proposal, it's latest plan, to 'consult' with first nations using a treaty negotiator, would have convinced me it is.'Consultations' with FNs is a responsbility of the company applying for the pipeline permit and as far as I can see that is Enbridge, not some appointee earning income from our tax dollars to frighten FNs into ceding their lands and rights. Stephen Harper has been whining for years now on how the little person is robbing the government blind through EI payments and whatever, and is apparently blind to the fact his government is now robbing us taxpayers blind to pay for services the private sector ought to be covering. For once I have to say thank goodness we have a Constitution in this nation that seniors legal minds, rather than politicians, get to interpret. This is one of those eras when each and every government proposal or deed ought to be run by a court for fairness as it is obvious that 'fairness' doesn't count in Harperland."
"Harper's Tories infuriated reasonable people in BC by basically saying that anyone concerned about the environment and who supported well-respected environmental groups were akin to rabid lackies of scarey foreign groups and swooped down trying to use Revenue Canada to seize some of their funds ,attempting to cripple them. That back-fired.They played dirty by hiding things in omnibus budgets and then sneered during QP at any legitimate queries from the Opposition. They have gutted environmental research as well as protection in the pursuit of the almighty dollar-at any cost. The BC government has given the feds a lot of power in terms of oversight as well. Enbridge has hardly been the poster child for environmental safety as well."
"The article misses some points but is in the right direction. The pipeline of course is the flagship of the discontent. But we cannot forget that it is the constant disregards of king harpo and his minions to the wants and needs of the people of this country that created this situation. The instant disregards for our democracy as they (falsly?) won majority... The bully attitude does not create a durable climate. Eventually the bully will have to be met on his own turf. Shady procedures, abuse of protocol, muzzling attempts, prorogation, Omnibus bills, closed chamber accords, media controls, propaganda, etc. are short term 'push'.They are used in the hope that they will influence faster then a possible response, but of course the response will come it has to, and the further the abuse goes the more destructive is the response. HitlerayatollahChaucheskuGeir Haarde... harper?Regardless if you know, like, approve, profit, agree with, what is being done in Ottawa these days you have to realize a lot of it is done in questionable legal grounds, at best. Some is clearly illegal according to our constitution and political history. harper is hoping he will get away with it before the courts (including the people's court) catches up with his doing. The people of BC have had enough, maybe because they were pressed the most (closely followed by NB etc?) the dialog is over because the trust is broken, this is a rogue government.'Let them eat cakes' she said..."
So looks like Alberta's oil bonanza is stranded! Someone should tell the oil companies that Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore oil (realized and potential) is easily transportable anywhere in the world. Let's see who freezes in the dark!
BC environmental hypocrisy over pipelines and oil sands exports is disgusting. Do any of you BC so-called environmental activists have any idea what BC coal is doing to our planet's environment? Have you seen what coal extraction is doing to your own province? Have you ever enjoyed the sublime delights of the bird sanctuary at Ladner with that monstrous Roberts Bank coal terminal eyesore in the background? Check out the greenhouse gas emissions from the coal industry in all its forms and then compare it to the greenhouse gas emissions from the petroleum industry in all its forms. How much of the coal produced in BC is consumed domestically? We all know the answer to that question. The goofy logic of the crazy BC Greens would say that not a single kilogram of coal should be produced in their province because there is no domestic market. You can not at the same time be environmentally 'pure' about the oil sands and completely ignore the environmental catastrophe BC coal is inflicting on our planet.
"I think your confused, the oil pipeline opposition in BC has absolutely nothing to do with climate change for the vast majority of us and everything to do with the destruction of a pristine rainforest and coastline that currently is a huge part of our economy, and renewable I might add too. Having said that, if others want to oppose tar sands pipelines because of bitumen's wheel to well carbon footprint the more the merrier I say, but blame American and European opinion if ya feel the GHG argument is a bum wrap."
"Where to begin? How did I and countless other BC residents feel about being labelled 'eco-terrorists' by our own federal government? Knowing that not only was the RCMP spying on environmentalists and other terrorists, but that the feds had established a special unit in Edmonton to do it? Why should we take Enbridge and its apologists in Alberta seriously when we know they lobbied - successfully - for the changes to the Navigable Waters Act, Fisheries Act and Environmental Review process that removed protection of virtually all the rivers the Northern Gateway pipelines would cross? I could go on, but if you want to have a rational discussion about climate change, the tar sands, and our lack of a national energy policy, then I'll listen."
"enviros are victims of their own success... as they grew in influence and power to stop projects, the govt thought the pendulum has swung too far and went about righting that imbalance. what you got was extreme re-writing of the playing field via environmental protection and habitat regulations....reep what ye sow... its all the lefts fault... now live with it"
"heavy crude pipeliners, tar tanker proponents, rats, shrews, lemmings and other vermin- see nothing wrong with soiling their own nest, yet they brand survivalists as radical environmentalists"
"Overly dramatic, self serving rhetoric? Seriously?! 1) No net benefit in the form of jobs or money for BC, yet 100% of the marine risk2) Any spill on our coast would be catastrophic. Combine this with harrowing seas, violent tidal swings and very narrow entrance to the Douglas Channel and you are guaranteed a spill. 'When, not If' does not work for the people of BC.3) Alberta already has plenty of pipeline capacity. The issue they face is over production! The Oil Sands should be a backbone to a strong economy for generations to come, it should not be THE economy. If they slowed the rate of extraction, demand would increase and so would the price the oil sells for, which brings me to;4) Because of the rush to exploit this resource we've suddenly - almost overnight - become a Petro Dollar. This rise in the value of the CDN $ has virtually crippled our manufacturing and high tech industries elsewhere in Canada, making us ever more reliant on Oil Sands revenue. Take this pipeline and Alberta's self centered, red neck attitude and shove it."
"love to vote for you, if you were a candidate."
so you go and prove his point by being completely over the top with specious claims and hyperbole...'any spill on the coast would be catastrophic' oh my...would the world end too!! what if it is a small spill like the one the Hartley bay natives did a few years ago? did their culture die... did the whole coast die?? I didn't think so.
"If Mr Mason doesn't believe that this issue has been reasonably debated, he hasn't been listening. Good grief."
"an article masquerading as a critique of Enbridge and harper, which is really shooting down the opposition to pipelines. don't buy this spin. the unspoken message in this article is that pipelines are good for Canada, and we need a 'reasoned' dialogue. it paints opposition to pipelines as damaging to Canada's economic interests. in other words it is repeating the harper line, and only slightly criticising the 'process' originally engaged in by Enbridge and the government, which allowed them to lose control of the narrative. so the pipelines and their safety records, or enormously increased tanker traffic on the west coast are not the problems.. what is the problem is that harper muffed his propaganda."
"1. LNG is far different from heavy tar sands crude. LNG is going to happen, it has the agreement of mostly all First Nations who's land their projects would traverse, I only know of one, which is only one tribe of that Nation who is opposed. But that Nation is fighting it because that is where all five pipeline if there were to get approved would traverse side by side, which is pretty scary. 2. it is impossible to hold foreign registered tar tankersliable for spills, Enbridge's Northern Gateway Ltd will not be required to carry enough liability to clean up a large spill like their Kalamazoo spill. 3. The great bear rainforest is pristine wilderness, and Douglas channel is one of the most dangerous channels to travel in the world especially in bad weather, which is pretty frequent there, even enbridge see's this fact a threat to their attempt to sell their pipeline that's why in one of their t.v. commercials they erased over 1000 square kilometers islands from their map to make it look like a nice wide open channel, when it's really maze of islands, here's a link to that: www. huffingtonpost.ca/2012/08/16/enbridge-douglas-channel-islands_n_1789223.html"
"I have to disagree on the LNG, I mean there is fracking and then there is fracking and it has some pretty extreme problems of it's own however, as long as they dont try to carve a new energy corridor out of the mountains and rainforest behind Kitimat, which would most certainly be followed by an oil pipeline, I'll wait till I see the plan. Prince Rupert is a huge maybe too. Also, if you are referring to the Unistoten clan of the Wutsuitan nation, they will never budge!"
the Unistoten look like a small bunch of anarchists who are against everything....they are overstepping their legal rights by a mile in turning away workers and threatening them. Having a strong opinion is one thing but threatening people and thinking you own the place is another thing completely
"if the Enbridge's Michigan, Wisconsin spills, and to a lessor extent, their record of 800+ large oil spills in the last 10 years wasn't a factor, this pipeline would be put through with great ease. However, a company with such a record of failures, lies and coziness to Harper, has caught the mistrust and ire of most. At this point large bitumen pipelines are not going to be built for the foreseeable future. Planet Earth 1, Harper/Enbridge 0."
"Yeah, what spin... elizabethmaymp. ca/news/publications/press-releases/2013/03/20/olivers-spin-fails-to-cover-a-negligent-record-on-tanker-safety/"
"Does anybody else see this piece, posing as a critique of Enbridge, to really be an attempt by the writer to brand those opposed to the Northern Gateway as 'overly dramatic' and 'self-serving'?"
"same writer thinks cristy can still win, dreamer...."
"'it's regrettable that a cogent conversation on this subject isn't occurring. Instead, any attempts at lucid discourse are being drowned out by overly dramatic, self-serving rhetoric that provides no good purpose at all. And we all lose in the process.'And you think you have a sane context. I totally disagree with you. You write this article and not mention climate change and global warming. You are completely missing the context of why tarsands expansion can not happen. Even from an economic sense in this context tarsands expansion needs to stop now. Yet you are unable to see this."
"Tar sands might be able to expand in the future, but only after the current sites are completely remediated and returned back the original state, with clean water and native wildlife. Then open the next site. Probably won't even need more pipelines."
"When the Harper Govt. declared war on science and the environment red flags went up all over the industrialized world! On issues related to responsible resource management and protecting the environment Canada no longer has any credibility! After all, actions speak louder than words!!"
"Bad journalism, Gary. I am disappointed. It could have been a simulatenously pro-business and pro-environment piece. Instead, it has some good points but it is not fully thought out, and frankly, lack the depth that I expected from you."
"good points? maybe for CNOOC, Syncrude, Exxon, Imperial, etc, but not for Canadians. certainly not for north coast sea creatures, who cannot speak for themselves"
Anything I've read of Gary Mason's sounds like he's from out of town and not particularly interested in what he's reporting on.
"Another slap in the face of British Columbians courtesy of HarperPartyGovernment? (a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the PRC) aka Harper Canada: h t t p://www.cbc.ca/daybreaknorth/interviews/2013/03/22/kitimat-mayor-rio-tinto-alcan-dont-know-what-public-port-announcement-means/What happened, Harper Canada? Couldn't be bothered to let us know? Or just don't care? Listen to the tape, Rest of Canada, and ask yourself if you would like to be treated this way? Another example of Harper and Enbridge and their culture of deviance."
"would affected northern BC residents accept the probable sale of Northern Gateway Inc to a communist China state owned corporationlike CNOOC or PetroChina ? would BC residents accept taking an influencial seat behind the Tibetan Monks and the Tiananmen Square protesters? Harper's heavy crude gov't has already signed the FIPA trade protection deal with communist China. when the FIPA with communist China is ratified, the existing Chinese controlled corportations operating in Canada will have the right to launch damage suits, in secrecy, with any change in existing lawsregulating labour, immigration, environmental oversight, tariffs, anythiing that may affect the projected profits of these corporations."
"Really? Enbridge Gateway? Responsibility for 'poisoning the well' for any reasonable discussion going forward rests entirely with the OFF (off fossil fuel) activists. Thanks for the general public brainwashing and misinformation campaign should be directed to the Dogwood Initiative, Pipe Up Against Enbridge, Greenpeace, Suzuki Foundation, etc. Enbridge has done nothing but take the high road, follow the regulatory process and stick to the facts."
'follow the (biased) regulatory process'and - heh- 'stick with the facts'?like the complete absence of inclusion ofthe causes of the Kalamazoo spill? and the magical erasing of all the Douglas Channel islands in Enbridge's pipedream propoganda add?
are you for real?
"A little perspective please, think of all the royalty income from the energy sector employing well paid taxpayers, where will much of the equalization payments come from? So concerned about the environment, what about the clear cut practices in the forest industry, how about air pollution from pulp and paper industry, how about the hydro lines that crisscross the province, entirely safe? Is a hydro electric dam that floods thousands of acres somehow better? A pipeline taking perhaps a 100 meter swath underground, plenty of checks along the way, pipelines already exist everywhere... hello out there! The country needs exports, what's the alternative?"
got any details on the 'plenty of checks along the way'? 'cause Enbridge was not required totable any details of their plans for'checks along the way'. trust? ask the Kalamazoo residents..
"The alternative is to have a responsible government and responsible industry. Both have proven to be highly irresponsible, especially when it comes to the environment. Both have shown they cannot be trusted. And yes, highfade, what about the forest industry, hydro lines? Plus, the NG is just a money grab from Alberta and CPC. You think BC people are going to get jobs from the pipeline? Think again. You think BC will profit when they hold all the marbles - and the risks?"
Part of the alternative would be to supply Quebec and the maritimes with Canadian product. They get it from such lovely folks as the saudis at the moment.
"by your tone, you would likely support child porn, legalizing heroine and meth if the tax dollars were your only concern."
"It is well to remember that as far as pipelines are concerned the operators have a positive incentive to keep the oil in the pipeline and out of the environment. This is even mor than motivating than the negative incentives of fines and regulations. The products that pass through the pipeline are valuable. The owners want to lose as little as possible not because they particularly care about environmental concerns but because the oil or bitumin slurry represents money. Pipelines are also relatively easy to turn off at least compared to oil tankers. Most serious oil spills from pipelines such as Kalamazoo could easily have been minimized if the operator had taken appropriate action. However instead of shutting down the relevant section they increased the pressure and thus the loss. I doubt that whoever made that decision had much job security thereafter. As Schiller points out, ' Mit der Dummheit k?mpfen G?tter selbst vergebens'.A refreshingly relatively neutral article. My compliments Sir."
the dilbit is not as valuable as theland it pollutes
you have contradicted yourself.
"How about this? The Enbridge Northern Gateway, a shortcut for the tar sands through the rainforest, is BC's risk. Ditto with the tankers. 300 tankers a year is probably the more realistic figure. Stating that after-the-fact safety measures will be put in place simply underscores our concerns out here - i.e. there will be screw-ups. Aerial surveillance of a spill is small comfort. Ergo, since there is a risk of screw-ups, the line should not be built. Come up with Plan B. We're not all tree-hugging extremists out here. Try the rail line from Tumbler Ridge to Rupert. It's already there."
"Unfortunately, I think the rail line would face opposition and blockades as well. And that would require courts and the police to enforce the laws which of late certain groups have immunity. Hopefully society is up for it."
Gee Tim what a good idea. But what about just carrying in paper cups one by one so that if one gets dropped little harm is done. Admittedly a bit labour intensive but hey we could use the jobs.
"yes, lets put joe oliver up in a small aircraft, at night in a snowstorm with 50 knot winds. see any oil there joe? idiots"
"2009. The height when a certain PhD showed up on a certain business channel and blew his stack. While I admire the tenacity on display from this son of the environmental movement, economics is not his strong suit nor the reasoning this article speaks of. There is no difference between BC, First Nations or Oakville/Mississauga. No one want's energy infrastructure but we all need it for a healthy economy. Electricity, gasoline, natural gas. Our mutual funds, stocks, ratings on our government debt. Jobs, social programs, national security. Something other than fossil fuels but what? The environmentalists have failed to provide a pragmatic alternative. The media speaks of slime algae, garbage and the sun but still no real world alternative. Paralysis on energy favours only the politician until unemployment levels, debt and the odd scandal skewer them in THE END."
and your very dull point is???
"PetroChina is poised to build Northern Gateway, using their own foreign labour and materials'PetroChina bids for US-$5.5Billion Northern Gateway'www.chinagoabroad.comis this the prosperity and jobs Harper's jesters arepromising? jobs for whom?"
"Actions speak louder than words isn't just a saying. If Enbridge had shown it was a responsible company by proactively going in and cleaning up its spills in the Kalamazoo river, for instance, those annoying ads might be more palatable. They could and should have taken lessons from BP. For all the negative press after the gulf oil spill, at least BP was shown taking responsibility. Likewise, the Federal government's announcements about spill responses are just noise until they show they are capable of action. Let them go in and figure out how to get the 700 tonnes of bunker c that has recently been slowly leaking out of the USAT Brigadier General M.G. Zalinski which sank in 1946. www.oceanecology.ca/zalinski.htmI think there probably will be a pipeline in northern BC, if Black gets his refinery going (which should be in Taylor, not Kitimat to avoid piping the bitumen over the environmentally dicey area, but he didn't ask my advice)But unless Enbridge puts its money where its mouth is and shows us it is a responsible company, their proposal is dead in the water."
"Actually, the federal government's star clean-up ship ran aground on the way to the news conference. www. vancouversun.com/life/environment/Vancouver+largest+spill+clean+ship+sandbar+route/8129094/story.htmlWonder why we're worried on the west coast?"
"THERE WILL BE NO NORTHERN GATEWAY PIPELINE THROUGH BRITISH COLUMBIA. Move on.Harper and Enbridge tried to ram this through by lying and distorting the facts. Harper and Enbridge operate in a culture of deviance and any number of airy-fairy ads and CPC Action! Plans cannot erase that fact. Read the NTSB Press Release regarding Enbridge and it's decimation of the Kalamazoo River spill, and the full report for the facts: h t t p://www.ntsb.gov/news/2012/120710.htmlIf Harper and Enbridge are so out to lunch as to suppose BC is 'just like Alberta' then they are even more stupid than we've seen so far. In BC we've seen a lot of stupid from the HarperPartyGovernment? (a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the PRC), and the simply laughable but sinister PR campaign of Enbridge."
"In his last sentence, the term 'self-serving' appears. Yes, we in BC are self-serving, looking out for ourselves and our environment so we don't become an oil-soaked wasteland like parts of Alberta."
Ha ha. Oil soaked wastland. Brush the cheezies off of your greenpeace t shirt and actually visit Alberta sometime. Your local service station's oil change bay is more oil-soaked.
Notice how the latest Harper gang ad about energy sources mentions everything except the tar sands? Northern Gateway: more than a pipeline - also a con job.
"just to repeat- it is impossible to hold foreign registered tar tankers liable for spillsEnbridge's Northern Gateway Ltd will not be requiredto carry enough liability to clean up a large spill like Kalamazoo it is disingenuous, misleading, for Oliver to brag thelow tanker spill record on the coast, since there will be 5 times the number of tankersplying the inner coast if harper's heavy crude gov't gets its way."
First of all Canada needs an energy plan for Canada. It is rediculus that Eastern Canada imports Oil when we have surplus in Western Canada. British Columbians are being told the pipleline is good for us when the opposite is true. A few jobs and all the risk! The negatives far outweigh the positives. No to Oil tankers plying the waters out of kitimat.
"Gateway is hardly dead since harper's heavy crude gov't now has the final say, which will be based on their science, they claim.. oliver announced yesterday, in the shadow of the budget, that Kitimat port was redesignated as a public port, this without consulting or even notifying Kitimat town or corporate stakeholdersat Kitimat. Canadians seem unaware that foreign registered tankers cannot be held liable for spills, and Enbridge's limited pipeliine liability ends at theshore."
a public port? this mean I can moor my boat for free? that I own it?what utter claptrap from mr oliver.
"I agree with the premise of this article and that is that the Feds and Enbridge realize that there is no way forward in the current climate, nor in the short term and that this may affect other proposals. What I think this article absolutely does not address is the impact that the Omnibus Bill had on the current situation. Changes to the Acts that govern water and environmental oversight and the treatment of scientists has caused moderates to become skeptical, the crowd inbetween strong environmentalists and pro-oil/business. Losing the moderates is why there will be no way forward. Trust. It caused moderates to not trust that the government would provide the proper oversight and at the same time, the consequences of the Kalamazoo oil spill were constantly highlighted in the media. Any cause that loses the large middle group will never win the cause."
"This is an excellant point. The loss of credibility associated with the gutting of protections in the omnibus bill, and now the closure of the ELA facility that has produced science to the benefit of all Canadians, has been lethal to the Conservative brand. Middle of the road people simply do not believe what this government says about environmental issues. The same outcome in the US over the Keystone approval is another example of their lack of environmental vision."
"Credibility??? The super-duper spill clean-up ship couldn't even make it to the news conference without running aground. www. vancouversun.com/life/environment/Vancouver+largest+spill+clean+ship+sandbar+route/8129094/story.htmlFortunately, it only hit a sand bar, but this certainly shows why there are questions that can't be answered."
"Most reasonable British Columbians would support a pipeline that was on a reasonable and different route, that had a credible risk mitigation plan and that had solid economic benefits to BC beyond simply passing Alberta's oil to Asia. Fact is many of my friends here in Vancouver were shocked to learn that full tankers of crude have been moving up and down Burrard Inlet for decades with no incidents - proving that we can move oil responsibly and safely IF (and it's a BIG IF) it's done right. Doing it right does not include risking pristine wilderness in dangerous waters that cannot be adequately patrolled let alone easily accessed should something go wrong. Doing it right involves consultation with stakeholders in BC and actually LISTENING to the legitimate concerns of British Columbians and then addressing these concerns in a substantive way. Doing it right is not having Alberta Premier Alison Redford going on national television to tell British Columbians that '...it's Alberta's oil but Canada's coastline'.So far it's not been done right and Mr. Mason calls it - the well is poisoned. A good pipeline proposal with a well thought out route, proper consultation with stakeholders and solid, real benefits to BC is going to have much more difficulty even getting a fair hearing. With an NDP government a certainty in two months, you can pretty much guarantee that there will be no new pipelines in the foreseeable future."
"While you are correct that tankers have been moving into Burrard inlet for decades they only number about one per week and they are tiny by comparison to the tankers that would be needed for export to Asia. For the most part I agree with your points on what would be required for BC to support a pipeline however, the conditions you've outlined pretty much guarantees that any new west coast pipeline wouldn't be profitable. Which is ok with most of us in the opposition to Northern Gateway. Many in the media like to bring up that we need plastics and that we drive cars etc, which totally looses sight of the fact that Northern Gateway and proposed Kinder Morgan expansion have nothing to do with domestic consumption and everything to do with export to Asia, that too has not helped the cause, anymore than Harper referring to regular BC residents as being radical environmentalists. Badge we now wear with honor thank you very much Mr. Harper."
"If the oil were for needed domestic consumption, there would be much less opposition, and a greater chance the pipeline would get built. Until that scenario happens, it will never get built."
I see the usual know-nothings are quick to comment and condemn British Columbians for having different values than the oil-soaked and dependent denizens of the flatlands. What a laugh!
"Well, these Enbridge transported fossils are not destined for domestic consumption. What a hyperbolist!"
"'Instead, the narrative ? pipelines are horrible, tankers will destroy the province and possibly the world ? was defined by the environmental movement and first nations leaders who felt they weren't properly consulted. Enbridge was knocked out before the fight really got started.'You're right! The ONLY reason Environmentalists and First Nations people are blocking the pipeline is out of spite for not being consulted early (and paid off properly).There could be NO other reasons for them to block the pipeline or the tanker traffic to Kitimat, right? And Enbridge's problem isn't a bad product, it's just bad marketing, right? The central thrust of your article - that the pipeline is likely doomed - is acceptable, but some of the reasons you lay out for it are not, sir."
"Perhaps you missed the Kalamaoo River spill and the fact it took Enbridge specialists 16 hours to realize there was a spill and then to shut the line down? No, it's not bad 'marketing', but a very bad product ( tarsands crude impregnated with toxic sludge to allow it to flow more easily), shipped through pipelines that are unsafe and overseen by Enbridge incompitants. There have been all sorts of efforts by the pipeline forces to 'pay off' some first nations leaders, which have resulted in the ouster of those very 'leaders' by their own membership. The greatest hurdle has been the sleeze exemplified in the efforts of both the industry and the politicians helping them, to intimidate environmentalists and FNs. Joe Oliver, is, in my book the Sleeze King."
"The HARPER should of let the normal process in place to do all the environmental reviews (that use to exist before The HARPER got involved, HE basically removed them all).Instead HE chose to try to RAM it through (kinda like how HE rams though OMNIBUS Bills too, with NO DEBATE ... because ... The HARPER knows BEST).That shows incredibly poor judgement. No one can believe anything now on this issue."
"If President Obama approves the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, then Alberta will rightly feel that USA is a more of a friend than British Columbia is.This might be the beginning of new separatism in Canada, where some Canadian provinces are so unfriendly with each other, that they would rather be a part of a friendly USA than unfriendly Canada."
"Let's not forget that Harper considers himself first and foremeost an Albertan, is at heart a western separatist, and loves the American Republican party, especially the Tea Party fringe."
Enbridge started by first trying to bribe the Indians and then lie about it . Then they stated they had agreements across BC with First Nations more lies .
then they made douglas channel look like the middle of the pacific. total BS
"Facts, the failure of Northern Gateway goes much deeper than pointing out the ignorance of the Anti pipeline ,Anti Oil Sands propaganda! First is that American Industrial interests headed by several funds led by the Rockefelle foundation selectively bought the green opposition with millions of dollars contributed through 350, org and Bill McGibbon and using Tides USA funded Tides Canada to the tune of 150 million plus the 30 million or so paid directly to BC First Nations to obstruct the process ! This info doesn't change the effective job that has been done in obstructing access to the Oil Sands! These industrial giants view Canadian resources as one might look on 'money in the bank' so to speak for future US needs and by doing this the energy is reserved for the US and kept out of Asian hands! Sadly the effort will not work and as we have seen by Obama's willingness to be played by Warren Buffett the Oil will go by rail to the nearest Terminal and then by barge! What won't happen is for it to be stopped, And the fact is America needs several million barrels a day of importated oil just to meet today's needs, and America is still dependent on Coal for much of it's electrical production 50% in fact! The joke is that American industry is building in Canada to refine, produce, export the very things that would have been done in the USA, because we need those by products ! The best the Anti Movement will do is frustrate themselves and redirect the dynamics going forward!"
The truly dumb thing is. The oil sands has enough to supply both Asia and the U.S and Canada for a couple hundred years.
If you are going to represent the views of the lunatic fringe it is not enough to include in your conspiracy theory the Rockefelle (sp.) Foundation and Warren Buffett. At least Bill Gates and the International Zionist conspiracy must also be mentioned. This gets a failing grade as standards have to be kept up but keep foaming. You show some promise in your ability to make up facts.
Its to bad. Makes us on step closer to a third worl country
"Not enough is made of the chronic and serial incompetence of Enbridge. From their inept handling of their pipeline spills in Michigan and Wisconsin to their ham handed planning with Keystone, it's no surprise their business plans keep going down in flames. It's only a secret to their senior management team that the Nebraska sandhills are a globally recognized and treasured environmental jewel. Why not try running a pipeline though Banff or Yellowstone? It's clear that management suffers from groupthink and is seized with nothing but brown-nosing 'yes' men. Republicans don't want a pipeline through the sandhills. This is something an unpaid intern could've found out had senior management been willing to listen or subscribed to National Geographic. The fact they've repeated this incompetence within B.C. speaks volumes about how shareholders are best served by replacing senior leadership with people who've a minimal clue."
"Endbridge as nothing to do with Nebraska! If you are referring to Keystone that is transCanada! As to Endbridge it's record forcthe last half century is one of the very best, demonizing it now is just stupid because Endbridge has the most to prove and therefore is the best choice! Pat McDaniels has been best CEO many times in Forbes, Time, Canadian top fifty etc! Throw the baby out with the bathwater!"
I stopped reading after keystone. When a person is not intelligent enough to know the difference between companies and projects. Well they really have no right to complain much.
"Richard _S to say that Endbridge is the best, is to play with figures. On large spills you are right, but on small spills you are out to lunch. The Alberta government only reports spills over a certain size. Any closer look shows that Endbridge record is not as good as it looks. The biggest problem with Endbridge, Alberta/Canadian governments and the media they think that West is Alberta, it is not. In BC we have a name for Albertans, we call them Easterns."
"Indeed, Otava, an unpaid intern could have discovered that Enbridge is not involved with Keystone XL and that pipelines (albeit smaller, distribution lines) do, in fact, run through Banff."
New Democratic MP Nathan Cullen maintained that the initiatives were an exercise in greenwashing ? a term for efforts designed solely to propagate the perception that an organization's goals are environmentally friendly.'....the harper TarSands/Budget Bill = HItler Enabling Act en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/timeline/enabling.htm
"Sick of your cons are liars theme the NDP in BC did more damage with lying during the Fast Ferries Scandal and later with Casinogate in which Dix was caught lying, but be selective, the Liberals are just dandy so how is it that the Cons are so bad?"
Cullen is bought and paid for enviro and natives (who are also bought by Tides et al)Cullen is against every major project in the northwest... the most negative politician the area has ever had
"When Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver announced plans this week to strengthen Canada's oil-spill defences, critics were swift to disparage the proposed measures.'...Joe Oliver , the CON minister who said he would drink from the toxic TarSands tailings ponds: http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/05/30/pol-mulcair-oilsands-alberta-trip.html>>> CONservatives just love to tell lies."
"One drink probably wouldn't do him any harm, but a lifetime of drinking dirty water, well that's not a pretty picture."
"Thanks for your unbiased, fair, and balanced article on the subject of pipelines, tar sands oil, and environmentalists, Mr. Joe Oliver .... oops, I mean, umm, Gary Mason. Your disparaging remarks about 'radical' environmentalists put you fully in the fossil fuel industry camp. While you pooh-pooh the safety concerns of the citizens of BC, elsewhere in the news are articles about Enbridge and the ongoing debacle of their pipeline spill in Michigan a couple of years ago - a 'minor' spill that will ultimately cost them a billion or more, and it still hasn't been cleaned up.So, thanks again for your opinions, Joe Oliver .... oops, sorry, I mean, Gary Mason."
"BC and it's billions in Coal royalties , mines, clear cutting, pulp mills etc is in no position to throw stones!

"The Liberal party, the NDP, and the green party, are all 'liberals'.They are all what any righties normally calls a 'lib-tard' or a 'commie'. They all support national health care for all, abortion rights, gay rights, higher taxes for the rich, and programs to help the poor. They are all very very similar. Green is just a little more extreme on the environment. The only conservative party, is the Harper party. So ALL conservatives only had one place to put their vote, and along with the 'swing voters' who got sucked in by the fear mongering about the collapsed economy, they only got 39% of the vote. The other 61% of the country voted for left wing parties. (NDP, Green, Liberal party)When you break it down by district, it's even more alarming. In district after district, you have the conservative party beating the 2nd place left wing part by mere single digits. Just imagine if these left wing votes weren't being split like this. Harper would have a few seats in Alberta and that's it.It's just incredible how badly representative democracy is failing us in Canada. 61% voted LEFT WING... and somehow there's a right wing majority. It's such a shame so many people just don't pay attention to politics. The liberals and the NDP need to give up their egos and join or figure something else out. It's not fair to let a minority drag the country down a path 61% voted against. seriously people. wake up."
"In full flight? Isn't this what a COWARD does? I see Ibbotson stating, I suggest approving, of Harper's 3rd time proroguing Parliament, out of fear that his mindset has not been beguiling the electorate anymore."
"If only Harper believed in capitalism, not Religousfare. Hey big spender, how about more freedom."
It seems to me that the conservatives are relying on growth to balance the budget instead of action. They created the largest public sector workforce in the history of Canada then will not make the proper cuts to reduce spending. Instead they hope that the growth rate in the country will be larger than anyone believes. Also they hope that they will receive all this money by having people turn in offshore tax cheats. That sounds good in theory but rich people are very resourceful and it is unlikely that they will receive a fraction of the money that they claim. All this will result in continued deficits in the future.

Good photo. Canada's worst ever pm shaking claws with Canada's worst ever finance minister.
"No mention of the destructive and stupid 60 billion tax cut to the largest and richest corporations. No mention ofthe gutting of science and the closing of environmental agencies. No mention of all the corruption, robocalls and election fraud. No instead this paper calmly goes where no Canadian should go. I think it is beyond clear to those who were sitting on the fence prior, that this paper is nothing but a propaganda rag for the Harper government. Not you, not Canada, the Harper government. Shae of you Grope and Flail!"
"'But there are abundant grounds to believe that businesses are having difficulty finding enough people with the right skills for a technologically advanced economy. This may have been mostly based on anecdotal evidence, but it is so persistent that it can hardly be dismissed.'Too bad we don't have some sort of agency to track this. You know, one that deals with statistics?"
I really wonder if anyone on the editorial staff of the Globe has an IQ above fifty sometimes.
The Globe and Mail has become a shameless shill for the CPC and Prime Minister Harper. A 'paper of record' should hold some independant values.
"'Canada has not developed much of a culture of apprenticeship, which has been so successful in Germany; neither companies nor education ministries have shown much enthusiasm.'No kidding, every employer and ESPICIALLY the various levels of government want fully trained seasoned people. Where do they find them? In the private sector. Private sector companies spend time and money training, and the government, with its bottomless wallet, picks our pockets. There should be a quota system on apprenticing, for public and private companies."
I have read more accurate editorials in The Onion.
"Why did they stop with only merging CIDA with DFAIT? There are natural synergies between Environment Canada and Natural Resources Canada. I suspect the only reason they didn't was that they wished to avoid the usual 'sturm and drang' (cue the Raging Grannies), and being portrayed in the media as anti-environment (even though such a merger would actually result in increased efficiencies and productivity, and no weakening of environmental protection)."
"Mr. Harper in full flight? Just like the Dodo bird of yore. Question: Why has the Globe ignored the retirement of Kevin Page and the PBO? The PBO was the best thing to happen to Canadian goverence and democracy I've ever seen and no mention of it at all. Shame on The Globe. Now you can go about glorifing the Harpainistas! without having to back anything up with actual facts, evidence or research. Good old upper class arrogance will suffice. How much lower can the bar be set?"
"why has the globe not mentioned the 60 BILLION dollars in tax cuts to mega corporations. Corporations which are not Canadian and hold no loyalty to us. No mention of Harper re-branding Canada as the Harper Government, or the billions we will be paying to support their bloated and unnecessary criminal 'justice' system and for profit jails. I will not pay a dime to read this rag. What a disgrace!"
"'It is a good initiative to make business a full partner.' Sure, if you ignore the fact that this is, in fact, subsidizing businesses for training that they should be paying for themselves. It's no different than PMAC (pharmaceuticals agreement with big Pharma)."
Creating a culture of entrepreneurship is difficult in a society not keen on success. Just look at our successful pop star of the moment. No opportunity is missed to poop all over Justin Beiber. As he is being celebrated in the US he is booed up here. We did the same thing to Celine Dion. Hard to strive in a climate like that. Pathetic.

"To Globe and Mail EditorsThe quality of most of the Globe and Mail articles is so bad that they are becoming not worth reading. Indeed most of the time, I prefer to read the commentaries than the articles. There is much to analyse and report but you are failing to do so.

Election slogan: ' Full Flight to Fox news in 'Fifteen '...
"The editor seems not to recognize the irony of the headline. When I saw 'In Full Flight', I assumed they meant retreat, as that expression usually is meant to suggest. Perhaps references to the F-35s or maybe the dream of senate reform. But no, apparently this 'full flight' is meant to convey that Stephen Harper is in his full glory. A nondescript budget that is nowhere near the numbers he's promised us for years. (Damn you, Europe! It's all your fault!) So, we're revving up the old Action Plan again, eh, Stevie? I guess a bunch of American sign painters are about to get rich."
I hope everyone noticed the G&M front page littered with 'ActionPlan2013' banners. That tells you everything you need to know about the posture of this paper. They have to get their full measure of the propaganda budget to stay in business.
Those stupid ads are everywhere ... I disliked it when the Libs did it under Chr?tien and I dislike that the Cons do it now .
"Oh man! The PMO is writing Globe Editorials again. Another budget that doesn't provide any details, centralizes more power in the PMO, and expects the Provinces to pick up the tab. News organizations should not be endorsing one political party over another. They should be objective."
"For those with an ax to grind against the Conservatives, you need to answer the following question honestly. Which party would you rather have running the country? The rudderless Liberals under Justin Trudeau (still can't believe this is about to happen) or the one time wonder NDPQ under Mulcair. Kudos to the Globe for recognizing this."
Good way of describing how bad our choices really are. So depressing to see such mediocre leadership - particularly when we are in probably the best position of any country to exploit opportunities in the global marketplace.
"Prefer either than the guy selling all our resources for dirt, importing cheap workers, signing deals with china that give them power to sue us, if they claim we somehow cost them money (after they've already sued 2 other countries for this)Harper is as tea party as can be. Religious conservatives are radical, and all have basically the same beliefs. Harper would love to ban abortion, close public schools, kill national health care and move all the funds to military, lower upper bracket taxes, kill the minimum wage. They all believe in these things... But Canada is a progressive country and they could never get away with it. But they're slowly chipping away at the safety net, lowering corporate taxes (which didn't give us any jobs btw), bringing abortion bans up for house debate (we all know this doesn't happen without Harper's say so-he voted no so he could get re-elected, but allowing it to come up, was testing the waters, how many votes could he get, how much public outrage.. etc)61% voted for left wing partiesonly 39% voted right wing"
Just one tiny step to shrink government and the left goes ballastic!!!
"This is still the largest Government in history. Harper has increased the public service substantially since taking office. It's not the left going ballistic, its people like me who expected better."
Smaller governments would help to restore the balance necessary to afford government services by the working base population not included in public services.
"Shouldn't expect much from scaleworker. He knows damn well under his dear leader, gov't employees have increased by 32,000. I hope the gov't stops funding the film/tv industry in Canada so scaleworker will have to get a real job. Not one that is totally dependent on gov't welfare."
And a terrible vision it is... This budget is the worst. We can all see the signs of a economic slowdown and Harper is once again refusing to act. And let's not get started on CIDA.
Read the column by Axworthy and breathe deeply. The CIDA move was a good one. The jobs hing is a joke.
The only thing workfare does is make mean spirited people think they are finally getting all those 'lazy bums' off of welfare. They have absolutely no idea what they are talking about and those recycled harris conservaties in this government know it. It just plays to their uneducated base.
"Hedonistic inclined welfare bums, no matter from the poor or rich end, will never subject them to workfare, they will actually reject and sabotage any attempt to make them work."
"Not true, I worked at social services and was directly involved with clients who were trying to make it work. You really have no idea what you are talking about"
Now I remember why I canceled my Globe subscription a few years back. This paper is desperate to justify its endorsement of one of Canada's worst governments. Seven years of incremental leadership that achieved nothing of note and now we're getting the 'vision' are we? You can't be serious. Or at least you can't be a serious paper with this kind of drivel. I have two free articles left this month. Think I'll leave it at that.
"So putting CIDA under Foreign Affairs is by itself an improvement in CIDA? How so?The Harper Government has already told us that it wants to use CIDA money as a support for Canadian corporations operating in foreign countries. That's not aid; it's a corporate subsidy. The aid will not go where it is most needed; it will go where Canadian companies can profit. How is that an improvement in CIDA? When it comes to the Harper Government, the Globe and Mail editorial board consistently displays a quivering naivete. This can be charming in children and youth; it is disingenuous in a national newspaper."
"CIDA was a cess pool of well educated folks zipping around the planet , living high off the hog , with no accountability to anyone , all paid for by the taxpayer. The stories I heard , and saw , were legend. They all knew how to buy the best wine on the menu the CIDA folks..."
"Given the tiny glimpses of Harper Government ministerial abuse we have had in Bev Oda's excesses and Peter MacKay's use of Canada's helicopters as his personal air taxis, moving CIDA into Foreign Affairs does not by itself guarantee that the problems you rightly mention will be solved. I have no problem with CIDA being made more accountable, and I don't even have a problem with it being more closely integrated with our foreign agenda; however, the Harper Government has already dropped very poor countries from CIDA where we don't have corporate interests in order to subsidize our corporations with interests in better-off countries. That neglect of the neediest in order to benefit Canadian corporations is the problem I have with this move."
"Nick I am no fan of gov t excess in any form. But I think that it is always there in some form for any political party. The CIDA case in my view was exceptional, in part because it either served corrupt corporate interests, or corrupt local govt warlords. The problem , in short, was that it did nothing very effectively . As for Oda , fire her... Mackey I don't know. Give him a bill I suppose... I don't where to draw the line on hat govt Tand E tuff. Thy all do it."
"Axworthy came out in support of decreased bureaucracy, his letter calls for a comprehensive policy, which he will not be getting from this government. Look for Axworthy's follow-up to be something along the lines of, 'they had a chance to set comprehensive policy but didn't take it.'"
B GoalWell said.
"Still no budget for the OMNIBUS Crime Bill rammed through last year ... just wait until the MMS start coming in.Remember, WE will have to pay $BILLIONS if not $10s of BILLIONS for The HARPER new PRISONS, the cuts in The HARPER's previous PHONY OMNIBUS Budget Bill won't even pay for the OMNIBUS [MORE] Crime Bill C-10 (The HARPER's NEW WAR ON POT that adds mandatory minimum sentences - MMS to non-violent marijuana offenses that will increase the chaos, violence and gangs in our society just like in the USA where its a complete and utter failure, the USA is trying to get out of MMS, its estimated 3000 to 5000 YOUNG Canadians will be imprisoned each year for non violent crimes that we on not imprison today and what damaged goods they will be when they get out) that the CONS RAMMED though OUR Parliament last summer with NO DEBATE ... just BULLYING and LYING (and FEAR of course) ... The HARPER Way. WE will not have safer communities, we will have a lot more DAMAGED and ANGRY young CANADIANS when laws and policy are based on NONSENSE and LIES .... we will have an increase in the chaos, violence and gangs just like in the USA. PS The MMS just started this past Nov 2012 so we will not start to see the PRISONS fill up until about two years from now, conveniently (or planned) after the next election. Lock up your kids before The HARPER gets them and ruins them (buy them lots of hockey equipment).PS The War on Pot is over in the USA, they are now playing dominoes. CANADA DESERVES BETTER."
"Dan ChanI often wonder why we have a central government which does nothing much except spent our tax money. May be slashing the number of MP's to half will help the budget. Combining CIDA with foreign affair will harm Canada's international image. There will be string attached to aids, a very narrow mind set. Canada has lost its characteristics under this Harper government. It is just like US."
left wing anti-government?You have it backwards. it's the right-wing that is anti-government...They would sell off the fire departments to private buyers if they could get away with it.
Vote swing of nearly 35% in Labrador says polls.'The Conservatives have tanked in Atlantic Canada while the Liberals have improved considerably.'
"The Globe and Mail is not the only reason I moved out of Canada, nor even the first, but the demise of the Mop and Pail (remember Richard Needham?) is truly emblematic of what is wrong with Canada these days. In the fifties, and for many years afterwards, intellectuals and intelligent people (not the same) read the Globe. They did not have American columnists int those days. Today I look at Google News and rarely do I hit upon a Globe article I want to read. I have just been told I still have 3 free articles before I have to pay... No, thanks, Globe"
"Go Steve,, Go...Bring Canada kicking and screaming into the 21st Century.. About time some concrete action is taken. As we used to say in my past career ' If you are not pissing someone off.... you are not doing your job '..."
Harper has been relentlessly dragging Canada back to the 19th century.
And your last reported I.Q?
Leap tall buildings in a single bound...............that's one of Justin's tricks.
"What? There is something wrong with delivering fork lift trucks to countries that have neither the infrastructure to maintain them, or the propane to run them? Come on, those idle, rusting hulks after a couple of years make great post industrialist sculpture, or a great source of iron and steel for local blacksmith. But think of all the great jobs they created in Guelph for an American Owned assembly plant. Gee, have you got your priorities all wrong."
"What it is, is just a way to cut, and even further depress Canada's reputation abroad. Cut cut cut.. so then he can cut cut cut rich people's taxes. He's already really trashed Canada's reputation abroad, got us kicked off UN security council. He's making us look horrible."
"Workfare, good grief, the most ill conceived program of the Harris years that literally did not work. It was expensive to implement and basically did nothing. There are may barriers to employment that are never addressed. Stupid is as stupid does"
Actually I remember reading several articles that pointed out that it DID work.
"I worked for social services during that time Lamont and it was an umitigated disaster. For the money spent there were few people it actually worked for and what it did was take money out of programs that did work. We processed so many people who you could not place. For instance, those with criminal records, those with no teeth, those who were illiterate etc. etc. The ill conceived notion that people don't want to work was proven over and over to false. They lined up, but employers didn't. There are many reasons people need social assistance but not necessarily because they are lazy. They lack skills, etc., training, education. They were expected to go to work, but were not given any extra money for bus passes etc. One young women had a placement 3 miles from her home and was off work at 2 in the morning. There was no bus yet she was expected to walk through a difficult neighbourhood to get home. Ask anyone who actually worked at social servcies during that time who was involved with the clients and they will tell you what a mess it was."
"Eliza.. your post is anecdotal information, the article I read, may have been just what the reporters at the time could find.. BUT I do remember some indication that it had accomplished most of what it had set out to do, especially, I believe in the lead city - Kingston.."
"Workfare has been a disaster wherever it has been implemented. There have been similar programs in the U.S. The U.K. has also had similar programs. It has not worked one iota to improve the quality of life for the poor in either of these countries. Investment in skills training is a far better route. Thankfully, this and the incentives to hire new employees are the only redeeming features in this budget. Of course, I would say good luck to the skills training initiative - it looks like a classic white elephant pie-in-the-sky program given the vague details and the 'plan' (cooperation with provinces and industry) to implement this."
"I worked in Kingston Lamont. They had the largest turnout, I actually worked directly with this. That does not mean it was a success in general because it wasn't. Having the most does not mean having much. They took money from programs that were working. They implemented two computer programs that were supposed to replace the old softward, we ended up with 5 separate programs. Most of the people could not be placed for the reasons I have already outlined. That was when I met Minister Baird. He did not impress me then and he certainly has done little to change my thoughts on that."
"I am not a fan of Harper, but neither am I so partisan as to not acknowledge when he gets something right. When it comes to taxation and spending, conservatism is the way to go. We need the solid Conservative policies to get the economy back on track so that we have a bit of a buffer before the Libs get back in and spend us back to the 1980's.This is what I love about Canadian voters: their pragmatism. We may not be enamoured with the Conservative's social policies but we love the way they fix the economy. We love the liberal's charisma and ideals, but we know they're not always the most practical dudes. Plus we know that both parties are riddled with selfishness and corruption. So we keep switching. And throw in the occasional minority government to keep them honest. (As honest as politicians can be.)"
"I think you have pretty much pegged it,they are all basically the same."
"Essentially, you are correct. This group of stumble-bums are pretty much right down the middle of the Canadian psyche. The will eventually meet their demise, but compared to the NDP, and an not quite redeemed Liberal party, they are the best out there right now..."
"I agree and when we get a little fed up, just harken back to Shawingate and Adscam and last but not least the Red Book."
"Hilarious. The margin for the over/unders for 'thumbs down' versus 'thumbs up' on the posts are pretty much precisely 8, on most comments/any new comment. So what is it?Software, or multiple logins? Just curious, as an academic question.."

I have been a regular reader/buyer/subscriber of the Globe and Mail for nearly half a century; this editorial is part of the reason why I will not be renewing my current subscription when it runs out later this year.
Please see my post of 9:15 today.
"Something in this budget makes no sense to me. They're going after the public service because it's politically popular where they spend $43 billion. But they are spending $45 billion in infrastructure. Why aren't they cutting $26 billion from infrastructure? It smells a lot like the Quebec construction corruption scandal. Where is this money going? What are the results? Here in Ottawa, we are litterally choking from lack of necessary infastructure improvements, yet they replaced an unnecessary bridge a little while ago. Why is the government paying the construction industry with money that we don't have?"
$2 billion from small business and $300 million from the Provinces on training. $25.8 billion deficit which will fall off precipitously after next year with no explanation or precedent - if I read the projections correctly. Mostly a cursory attention to the spending side and primarily an emphasis on revenues. A deficit reduction strategy that banks on catching two running aces - presumably on the expectation of better revenues on commodities - year after next - even though keeping prices that high to close that kind of gap for any sustained period of time will cause a global recession. I'd say it's unrealistic. It's kick the can down the road for the most part and plucked a few feathers. Looks like they are setting up for fight with the unions next year. Euphemisms like 'Conservatism in full flight' - seem a little rhetorically grandiose.
"And for those of you wanting to read an actual editorial instead of a senate application to Stephen Harper, here is Andrew Coyne. fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/03/21/andrew-coyne-sure-the-budget-is-bloated-cynical-dirigiste-and-incoherent-but-we-expected-that/"
Thank you. 60 billion in corporate welfare - not mentioned here at all. This paper is a disgrace and should just rename itself the Harper Post
"Aid (CIDA) was rolled into FA because that way they can continue the practice of providing corporate welfare to their Canadians business supporters in the form of contract guarantees on international deals. They come back from 'x' country with signed 'deals', guaranteed by CIDA so that, if the deal goes through, CIDA pays part of the bill to the Canadian company on behalf of the buyer while, if the deal fails (as most do) the taxpayer will pay the company the money directly as their guarantee. All you need for these sweet deals? Make a few small donations to the Conservative and Liberal parties and attend a few $10,000 per plate dinners. Sweet"
"from the editorial: 'The decision to move CIDA inside the Department of Foreign Affairs, making it essentially an arm of Canada's foreign policy, is bold. CIDA has long been a dysfunctional agency. Because of its bureaucratic mindset...'So you're claiming that their isn't a 'bureaucratic mindset' in the Department of Foreign Affairs?"
The G&M has never thrown a punch it didn't pull when criticizing the Harper government.
I'm very disappointed in the G&M NOW.
Don't expect much from the corporate media.
...'how about training for real jobs they can give you that will buy you a house in a few years?'...wont work Ark as Jim'Free Market' Flaherty will just phone all the banks & bully them into jacking the morgtage rates
OK let me do the Liberal left wail... we had a surplus... then the three Amigos said spend or we will torpedo the Government. Harper spent... then the Three amigos said spending wasn't happening fast enough and the magnitude was too small to help the recession... now Harper lops off the spending and the Liberals here wail away... it's all Harpers fault. OK I get that... so?
No that is not correct.
"Ark ,most of that dough went to useless pork riding projects... the auto bailout was def. woth it & the $ paid back to the feds & Ont govt. with interest"
How is it the oppositions fault that Harper blew the Liberal surplus and contingency fund before stimulus spending and the recession that Harper said would not come? The guy is a failure. PERIOD and after 10 years still blaming his failure on the opposition. I suppose his elections fraud scams are the Liberals fault too.
"And as the two above point out, when the money was spent it wasn't to their liking. OK Kirsten, Hunter, how SHOULD the money been spent? Details, please."
Ok details please. Why did Harper spend the money before the recession he said would never come. Harper blew the surplus before stimulus. Harper is a proven failure.
"Let me do the Conservative wail....Adscam, Adscam, the coalition made me do it, I'm not responsible, It's Pierre Trudeau's fault, It's the global economy's fault, Adscam, Adscam, Blah, Blah, Blah....."
So much for Quebec kids wishing Liberal arts dgress and working (perhaps) at Radio Canada... how about training for real jobs they can give you that will buy you a house in a few years?
Are you kidding? The government is playing down home ownership now. Arts degrees for all!

Must really peeve off the Adoring Liberals that Harper has outflanked/ out thought and out manoevered them ...oh wait back to the really peeved off...
"Ark, in politics there is no beginning and end. It's an ongoing process - or, if you want sport or war analogies, the words 'outflanked' and 'outmanoeuvred' are only temporarily suspended by an election."
Well I would agree that Governments... eventually defeat themselves...
"'Prime Minister Stephen Harper, in full flight'...when I saw the article title I was hoping for something along the lines of he & his caucas 1 step ahead of an angry mob of outraged citizens fleeing Ottawa... just have to wait a bit longer for that scenario I guess"
"LOL... or both DM....as to the former, I wonder if Wendte knows one of hers is missing?"
What a shameless load of hooey. Was this written by Tim Powers? No mention of all the scandals that are dragging Harper and the CPC down into the gutter. What a joke.
What scandal?
"James123, MW is simply echoing the tone of this rubbish article: say something damning without providing any supporting facts."
Interesting that the highest rated comment has been removed for violating 'our Terms and Conditions'. Normally I would never comment on this and now I guess I'll never know.
who is writing this pap!?
"That would have been my guess. The real question is who on the editorial board allows it to be published? Given how progressive and responsible the paper is on other issues, including its own actual reporting on this government, it's remarkable how out-of-touch the editorial page remains."
Harper has been destroying Canadian parliamentary democracy. That is Harper in full flight.
"Harper's fault, Harper's fault. LOLYou haters break me up. What will you do years from now when Canadians hand him an even larger majority. Before the worst record defeat Liberals ever witnessed in Canadian history you guys were claiming that the Liberals were going to win. At least the more civil are profoundly entertaining while the rude ones always reflect who and what they support in poetic justice."
"MVP10, You are completely right! The Lord Harper and his Monarchist Government has indisputable destroyed Democracy and the Rule of Law. They treat citizens as of they were mere animals with no rights."
Stephen Harper in full flight.....full on elections fraud and daily lying.
